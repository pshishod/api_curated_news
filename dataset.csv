https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2021/05/31/celtics-fan-arrested-throwing-bottle-kyrie-irving/5279082001/,Boston Celtics fan arrested after allegedly throwing water bottle at Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving,"The Celtics fan who allegedly threw a water bottle at Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, who used to play for Boston, was arrested and charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon, according to a report.Boston Police sergeant detective John Boyle told USA TODAY Sports in a phone call that the suspect apprehended for the alleged incident, Cole Buckley of Braintree, Massachusetts, is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Boston Municipal Court. The fan is also subject to a lifetime ban from TD Garden in Boston.The arrest took place at 9:46 p.m. ET.The incident happened Sunday after Brooklyn's 141-126 victory in Game 4 of the first round of the NBA playoffs. As Nets players were leaving the floor, Irving walked into the tunnel when a water bottle thrown from the stands nearly hit him.""It’s unfortunate that sports has come to a lot of this kind of crossroad where you’re seeing a lot of old ways come up,"" Irving said after the game. ""It’s been that way in history in terms of entertainment and performers and sports for a long period of time. It’s just underlying racism and treating people like they’re in a human zoo – throwing stuff at people, saying things. There’s a certain point where it gets to be too much.”YES Network, the Nets broadcast partner caught the incident on camera, which marked the fourth time in the last week that fans at NBA games have allegedly thrown objects at players or have shown unacceptable behavior.Moments after the incident, cameras also showed Buckley, 21, being escorted out of the TD Garden. Moments before the incident, Irving appeared to step on the Celtics logo at midcourt.Irving scored 39 points on 11-for-24 shooting, including 6-for-12 on 3-pointers.Before the best-of-seven series headed to Boston for Games 3 and 4, Irving said, “Hopefully we can just keep it strictly basketball (and) there’s no belligerence or any racism going on, or subtle racism (or) people yelling (expletive) from the crowd.”Irving played for the Celtics in 2017-18 and 2018-2019 and signed with the Nets during free agency in the summer of 2019. The Nets have a 3-1 series lead.Contributing: Jeff Zillgitt",author,date

It was his fourth Indy 500 win – with a thrilling finish – and a record-tying victory that elevated the already legendary driver into an elite category with A.J. Foyt (1961, 1964, 1967, 1977), Al Unser Sr. (1970, 1971, 1978, 1987) and Rick Mears (1979, 1984, 1988, 1991).But win No. 4 came 20 years after his first and 12 years after his most recent one. Previously winning the 2001, 2002 and 2009 Indy 500s all with Team Penske, Castroneves is now the first driver to win ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" with two different teams.And he did it by patiently out-smarting the field, which set the record for the fastest Indy 500 in history with an average speed of 190.690 miles per hour.Less than a day after Castroneves climbed the fence lining the frontstretch of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, kissed the bricks and doused himself in milk, For The Win spoke with the 2021 Indy 500 champ.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.So how does it feel, the four-win club? Has it sunk in yet, or did it sink in right away?Castroneves: Actually, [I was] taking pictures right behind [here] with the car, and I saw the newspaper. I'm like, I started getting emotional again. It is an incredible feeling.Rick Mears sent me a message and like, ""Call me when you have a chance. I know you're busy."" I was like, I want to, I'm dying to call him. We've known each other for a long time, and I really cherish the friendship, and so it feels great. And I don't know how it feels right now, to be honest, like shocked in the moment.Have you slept at all?Castroneves: I went to sleep at three o’clock in the morning trying to answer the messages. I had about 400 messages, and half of them was from Team Penske, which is great. My friends from there, which is really cool to have them cheering me up and what a special thing.After the race, you jumped into Conor Daly’s arms, you celebrated with your old Team Penske teammates, you got a kiss from Mario Andretti. What does it mean that all these other people — a lot of them who are competitors of yours — were so excited to see you win the Indy 500 for the fourth time?Castroneves: It shows respect, and what we did here was something special. We’re part of history here, been 30 years since a driver won four times, I think. A lot of the fans love to see that. Probably some of the drivers, they say, “If I cannot win, I want to see or I want to be part of history.” Well, it happened. So I feel when everybody expressed their feelings, the way I see it, it’s respect.What was the highlight of your celebration?Castroneves: I don’t know, I had so many! With the crowd. I have to say, the crowd chanting my name, that was something that I was very touched by. That was something very special.After you climbed the fence last night, you crouched down for what seemed like a moment of disbelief. What was going through your mind immediately after you won?Castroneves: I couldn’t contain my emotions. Well, this is something that my mom always said. You know, “You got to be yourself, and if you’re happy, you’re happy. If you’re sad, you’re sad.”But yesterday, I couldn’t contain my emotions. How incredible we were able to achieve that, the way we did it — that’s why I was so emotional.You talked about winning one for the old guys and mentioned Tom Brady. If you could have a celebratory drink with Tom Brady tonight, what would you want to say to him?Castroneves: I want to say how he did it, because that was my first question after the Super Bowl was over. It’s like, “That is incredible.” I want to ask [him] how he did it.Well, I gotta change that question now. I would say, “How long you want to keep going? I will follow your footsteps.”Simon Pagenaud pointed out between Lap 185 and you making your move to the front, you were just playing along and trying to figure out what was going on. And team co-owner Mike Shank said he realized a little bit earlier that he thought you were playing a chess match. Is that what you were doing, just planning and waiting?Castroneves: Yeah, my car gave so much opportunity for me to do what I want, and because of that, I had the luxury to be stalking people and not want to pass. And that was my goal, waiting for the right opportunity for us and put myself in the position and studying a little bit my opponents. That, for sure, was a great strategy.And the team noticed that. I didn’t talk much. I guess they realized what I was doing, and they just let me do my thing. And my thing turned out to be the right thing.Does that mean you’re the smartest driver out there?Castroneves: Yesterday, for sure. Not always. But yesterday, for sure.You said you had the luxury of being able to stalk your opponents. How far out are you planning that? Is that your plan from the beginning of the race, or do things shift a little bit once you get to the halfway point or 50 laps left?Castroneves: No, that was Lap 2, probably, I already started doing what I need to do, and from there on, that’s what paid off. In fact, the first yellow, we saw so many good contenders have issues, and we’re the same strategy. But we were just a little bit better, and that’s what it takes.Going into Sunday’s race, did you have any kind of feeling that the day might be a little extra special?Castroneves: I felt confident. I felt focused. I felt good. I felt trust. I felt ready. But again, this place is not about what you feel. This place, basically, [is about] who is the winner? And I had all the checkbox lists. So I put myself in this opportunity to make that happen.Is a fifth Indy 500 win possible? Is that something you’d like to pursue?Castroneves: Absolutely. I mean, come on! People have doubts. Yes, it was 12 years of waiting, but I never stopped believing. That’s why I’m still doing it. And I tell you what, there was a lot of people around me that believed, as well, and that’s why Mike Shank and the entire group believed me. So what we did, what we had, was awesome. But we can do more.Years from now, what do you hope you remember about Sunday’s race?Castroneves: I believe there was so many mixed feelings from not only myself but the entire fans. First time after the pandemic that everybody was able to get out their houses and join the incredible day, which was a beautiful day. But I want them to remember, we did something special. Not many people were able to see a four-time win, and yesterday we were able to see that. And I’m glad I was able to provide that.",author,date

https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2021/05/31/french-open-american-coco-gauff-looks-ready-grand-slam-challenge/5274565001/,"Opinion: American Coco Gauff, now 17, looks ready to challenge French Open","Nearly two years ago, Coco Gauff became a very famous tennis player when she made the fourth round of Wimbledon at age 15. When she followed it with a third-round showing at the U.S. Open and another fourth round at the 2020 Australian Open, beating Naomi Osaka in the process, it seemed as if the hype train might spin out of control before she was even old enough to join the WTA Tour on a full-time basis. It was, in many ways, a dangerous time for Gauff’s career. Tennis’ penchant for heaping pressure on young phenoms before they’re ready to handle it either emotionally or meet those expectations on the court is an all-too-familiar story. But then a strange thing happened. For whatever reason — probably some combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and problems with her own game — the storylines positioning Gauff as tennis’ next big superstar kind of disappeared. It was probably the best thing for her. As the French Open gets underway, there is plenty of discussion about Rafael Nadal’s quest for a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam title, Roger Federer’s return to the big stage after two knee surgeries last year, Serena Williams trying again for No. 24 and Osaka announcing she won’t do interviews during the tournament after two straight Grand Slam wins but a spring in which she struggled on clay. There’s not nearly as much buzz about Gauff now as there would have been, say, a year ago had the French Open been held May. It has died down considerably since she beat Venus Williams at Wimbledon and became one of the biggest stories in sports, an event that now feels like a pretty long time ago. But something significant has changed between then and now, even if it’s been largely ignored by the American news media and general public. Still only 17, Gauff has worked her way into becoming a real factor in women’s tennis, not just for the promise of what she could become but what she already is. FROM THE ARCHIVES:Coco Gauff embraces Michelle Obama's advice for the U.S. Open and beyondANALIS BAILEY:It's time to accept that Naomi Osaka is human before she's an athleteFor the first time in her career, Gauff enters the French as a seeded player, up to No. 25 in the world after starting the tour’s post-COVID-19 pause last August at No. 53. She will start at Roland Garros on Tuesday against 57th-ranked Aleksandra Krunic and will be favored to at least reach the third round, where she could play No. 13 seed Jennifer Brady. But unlike her previous Grand Slam experiences, it would not be a surprise this time if Gauff ends up advancing deep into the draw.During the clay season this spring, Gauff has won 12 of 15 matches and played probably the best tennis of her career just last week in Parma, Italy where she won the Emilia-Romagna Open for her second WTA title. Prior to that, Gauff made the semifinals at the Italian Open where she notched wins over No. 18 Maria Sakkari and No. 4 Aryna Sabalenka, who has been one of the most in-form players on the women’s tour this year. Perhaps Gauff isn’t quite ready to win a Grand Slam, but it’s no longer a reach to think that she could do it.“I think I have been playing a lot freer, and I think you can see it while I’m on the court,” Gauff told reporters at her pre-French Open news conference Friday. “That’s how I’m going into this tournament. I just feel like even now when the score is a little bit tough, instead of stressing out I think I’m really just enjoying the pressure and enjoying the moment.” With a talent as prodigious as Gauff, there was probably no reason to worry whether the exceptional flashes she showed at 15 would translate into becoming a big-time player. At the same time, there have been some hiccups along the way. After the COVID-19 pause last summer, Gauff didn’t necessarily look like she had taken a big leap forward. Beyond the uneven results, including a first-round exit at the U.S. Open and a loss to qualifier Martina Trevisan in the second round at the French, it seemed like opponents had figured out how to play Gauff, targeting her sometimes inconsistent forehand. Gauff also struggled to close out matches, due largely to a serve that became too unreliable under pressure. But in the past month, it seems Gauff’s development has sped up considerably. Her forehand looked more solid than ever in Italy, and she’s been able to cut her double faults from 8.3 per match last season to 5.5 this year. Already one of the best athletes in the sport, her ability to defend is made for the clay, and the way she has played on it so far suggests a high tennis IQ and growing ability to build points and be selective in deploying her weapons. When young phenoms get the kind of results Gauff had at age 15, there’s a natural temptation to expect a lot very quickly. In previous generations, it was unusual but not unprecedented to see women at 16 or 17 compete at the very top of the sport and even win Grand Slams. For a variety of reasons, it's tougher to do that now. With all the potential pitfalls of too much, too soon, it’s probably a good thing that Gauff — even as mature and comfortable as she seems in every public setting — was given some time and space for her game to develop without the massive pressure that she needed to start winning Slams. And we’re still a long way from that. Even if she gets to the fourth round of this tournament and loses to No. 1 seed Ash Barty, it will be a huge success.But it’s no longer wise to rule out the possibility of Gauff doing something even bigger at these tournaments. These days, she absolutely belongs among the best players in the world and her time to win big trophies doesn’t seem too far off.",author,date
https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/baseball/2021/05/31/ncaa-baseball-tournament-has-arkansas-top-seed/5284166001/,Arkansas earns top seed for NCAA baseball tournament,"OMAHA, Neb. – Arkansas was rewarded Monday for its dominant run through the Southeastern Conference, landing the No. 1 national seed in the NCAA baseball tournament.The Razorbacks (46-10) won all 10 of their SEC series and wrapped up their first conference tournament championship on Sunday. After losing three straight games in March, the Hogs never lost consecutive games.This is the third tournament in a row that Arkansas has been a top-eight national seed.“It’s still really special just to sit there and see your name called,” coach Dave Van Horn said after his team gathered to watch the selection show. “Such a good season up to this point.”The 64-team tournament opens Friday in 16 regionals. Winners advance to eight best-of-three super regionals. Those winners move on to the College World Series in Omaha.The top eight national seeds are assured of hosting super regionals if they win their regionals.The national seeds following Arkansas: Texas (42-15), Tennessee (45-16), Vanderbilt (40-15), Arizona (40-15), TCU (40-17), Mississippi State (40-15) and Texas Tech (36-15).TOP 25:Complete USA TODAY Sports baseball poll before the NCAA tournamentTexas has its highest national seed since it was No. 2 in 2010, and the program will be making its NCAA-best 60th appearance in the tournament.Tennessee, at No. 3, is hosting a regional for the first time since 2005, the year the Volunteers last advanced to the CWS. There was a more relaxed vibe around the team on Monday compared with in 2019, when the Vols barely made the tournament with a losing SEC record.“Guys are playing hacky sack two minutes before the (selection show) starts,” coach Tony Vitello said. “Really, after 30 minutes of the show or when we knew who we would play in Game 1, they kind of were ready to move on.”Vanderbilt, making its SEC-best 15th straight tournament appearance, will be going for its third national championship since 2014 after winning the title two years ago. There was no tournament in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Seeds nine through 16 are Stanford (33-14), Notre Dame (30-11), Old Dominion (42-14), Mississippi (41-19), East Carolina (41-15), Oregon (37-14), Florida (38-20) and Louisiana Tech (40-18).The SEC led all conferences with nine teams in the field, followed by the ACC (8), Pac-12 (6), Big 12 and Conference USA (4) and Big Ten (3).The last four teams selected were Alabama, Michigan, North Carolina and UC Santa Barbara. The first four out were Baylor, Pittsburgh, Georgia and Ball State.Baylor would be first in line to replace any team that can’t play its regional because of failure to clear COVID-19 testing protocols.Stetson athletic director Jeff Altier, the Division I Baseball Committee chairman, said varying scheduling strategies because of the pandemic made the task of selecting at-large teams extremely difficult.Altier said the opinions of regional advisory committees weighed heavily in the decision-making. Typically the RPI, or rating percentage index, helps the committee decipher teams’ comparative strengths, but it wasn’t as useful this year because several conferences didn’t play outside their leagues.“It was an incredibly difficult year,” Altier said. “Nobody experienced COVID before. We look at the RPI as a tremendous metric for us to help us evaluate, and in a year where you cannot play everybody across the conferences as typically you would do, it makes it difficult to choose.”Other notes about the tournament:– Old Dominion (42-14) is the top seed in the regional hosted by South Carolina. The Gamecocks are No. 2. Old Dominion did not submit a bid to host.– Florida State (30-22) has the longest active streak of tournament appearances at 43.– Big Ten regular-season champion Nebraska’s appearance in the Arkansas regional creates one of the top early storylines. Razorbacks coach Van Horn led the Cornhuskers to their first two CWS appearances in 2001-02, and current Nebraska coach Will Bolt was a middle infielder and captain on those teams.– Presbyterian faces its old coach in Vanderbilt’s Tim Corbin. The school gave Corbin his first head coaching job (1988-93).– Fairfield (37-3) became the first Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference team to earn an at-large bid. The Stags won 28 straight to open the season and finished the regular season 35-1. Their .925 winning percentage is the highest in Division I history.– Virginia Commonwealth (37-14) has the longest active winning streak at 21 games.– Jacksonville (16-32) has the worst record in the field. The Dolphins went 3-15 in the ASUN Conference before winning the league tournament.",author,date
https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2021/05/30/anthony-davis-injury-puts-nba-playoff-pressure-lebron-james-lakers/5277705001/,Opinion: Can LeBron James carry Los Angeles Lakers in NBA playoffs without Anthony Davis?,"LOS ANGELES - The Lakers’ star delayed Father Time with his blessed genes, impeccable talent and disciplined work habits.  With those same qualities, can LeBron James also keep the Lakers’ championship window open without Anthony Davis?“These shoulders were built for a reason,” James said. “If it takes for me to put some more on top of it, then so be it. Win, lose or draw. I’m ready for the challenge.”Neither the Lakers nor James were exactly ready for the challenge with adjusting immediately without Davis, who missed the entire second half of the Lakers’ 100-92 Game 5 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Sunday at Staples Center after straining his left groin. The Suns secured the win to tie the series, 2-2, after the Lakers floundered on offense in the third quarter. They mustered up only 15 points on 3-of-16 shooting during that stretch.If the Lakers failed to win Game 4 without Davis, it is only fair to wonder if the Lakers can win the rest of their first-round series against Phoenix, let alone defend their NBA championship. There is a reason why James advocated so loudly for the Lakers to acquire Davis from New Orleans two years ago. There is a reason why the Lakers gave up significant pieces of their young roster along with draft picks to acquire Davis. Therefore, James conceded, “if he’s not ready for Game 5, it’s going to be a tough blow for our ball club.”NBA PLAYOFF SCHEDULE:First-round matchups, results, game times and TV info'WE CAN BE BETTER':Year after NBA Finals trip, Miami Heat's season comes to an early endThe Lakers did not have immediate answers on Davis health, either. Davis did not speak to reporters afterwards. Lakers coach Frank Vogel added that Davis is “undergoing further medical evaluation.”Therefore, it remains unclear if Davis’ latest injury matches the level of seriousness that James experienced when he missed a combined 27 games during his first season with the Lakers after also spraining his left groin. Or, if Davis can become available almost as quickly as he did after returning from a left knee injury that disrupted his play in Game 4 (six points on 2-of-9 shooting) after not limiting him at all in Game 3 (34 points on 11-for-22 shooting).Regardless of Davis’ availability, the Lakers still must wrestle with a big-picture question. Can the Lakers win without relying on him?“It’s about putting our team in position to be successful,” James said. “It starts with my approach and it starts with my accountability. It starts with everybody else.”It might be tempting to roll an eye at the Lakers touting their “next-man up” mantra. Remember when the Lakers went a combined 7-10 without James and Davis? Remember when the Lakers still played badly enough upon their return that they dropped into the play-in tournament? And now that the Lakers are playing against a playoff-quality team in the Phoenix Suns, we’re supposed to believe they’re equipped to deal with this challenge after failing to do so in less pressure-packed regular-season games?All fair points. But consider the context. The Lakers went 7-6 when James played without Davis, but they won six of their final eight games following a 1-4 start. That captures the Lakers experiencing initial hiccups before Vogel figured out rotations and his players improved their chemistry. The Lakers’ struggles continued only because James then experienced his own injury.A similar development played out in Game 4 itself. The Lakers recovered from their horrendous third quarter by becoming more efficient in the fourth (27 points on 52.6% shooting). James also scored 11 of his 25 points, and became increasingly aggressive both with scoring and setting up the offense. If not for Marc Gasol committing a turnover at the top of the key, and James and Dennis Schröder missing two open layups while trailing by five with about 90 seconds left, the Lakers arguably could have won Game 4.Well before that, James also made plays suggesting he made progress with his right ankle injury that sidelined him for a combined 26 games. James threw a nifty behind-the-back pass to Ben McLemore.  James then performed a nifty spin move before finishing with a dunk. “I feel pretty good,” James said. “I continue to work on my body. I continue to work on my ankle. I work on my pace and continue to work on everything that held me out for so long. Every day, I’m putting in timeless work on my body, especially getting it back into full strength. Testing it out on the floor helps a lot.”Therefore, the 36-year-old James might be primed to be playing at his best just as he’s about to miss his star teammate. And he certainly has enough credentials to show he’s ready for the moment..James led a Cleveland Cavaliers team without any All-Stars to the 2007 NBA Finals. When Vogel coached the Indiana Pacers while James won two NBA titles in Miami, Vogel noted that game planning for James became even more difficult when he assumed more responsibilities to account for any injuries to Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. James helped Cleveland become the only franchise in NBA history to overcome a 3-1 Finals deficit, while defeating a Golden State Warriors team that set the record for most NBA regular-season wins.James could not win with the Lakers his first season before they had Davis. But consider that the Lakers missed the playoffs during James' first season largely because of his injury. In the game that he injured his groin, the Lakers defeated the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day and had a respectable 20-14 record. At the time, the Warriors thought internally they would face the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. Then, James and the Lakers' young core all had significant ailments. “The best teacher in life is experience,” James said. “So for me personally, I look forward to the challenge. However the hand is dealt, I’ll be ready to play.”Unlike when other NBA stars elevate their games in high-stakes games, James’ importance goes beyond just taking more shots. James’ whole game predicates on making the right basketball play. So even if the Lakers’ supporting cast have experienced inconsistency, James will elevate them putting them in the right position to succeed with open shots at the basket or from behind the perimeter. Expect James to score a lot more points and help his teammates do the same thing, too. “It’s not about throwing it into ‘Bron the whole time,” Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma said. “Obviously he’s great in his own right. But we have to play basketball.”Will that be enough for the Lakers to win Game 5 against Phoenix, let alone survive their first-round playoff series and beyond? Who knows.Suns guard Chris Paul had 18 points and nine assists in what Vogel called “the best game in his series” after having limitations earlier with his injured right shoulder. The Suns have promising depth with Devin Booker (17 points, five assists), Jae Crowder (17 points), Deandre Ayton (14), Cameron Payne (13) and Mikal Bridges (11).But for those ready to proclaim the Lakers’ season over because they have an injured star player?

As Jericho began to beat down MJF, Strong tossed him some footballs to throw at MJF. Jericho then asks Meyer if he could use his laptop, which Meyer hands him and then Jericho uses to hit MJF.The segment in Meyer's office ended with Jericho pushing MJF out on a chair before telling the coaches to, “have a great season.” Meyer responded by saying, “Holy (expletive).""Jericho told media members after the pay-per-view event the segment with Meyer was fun and one of the highlights of the night.OPINION: No harm in Jaguars giving Tim Tebow a chance to help at tight end'Deal with the devil': How 'Dark Side of the Ring' allowed professional wrestlers a glimpse into their tough world""The best part was when we said, ‘do you mind saying holy (expletive)?’ and I thought he’d say no.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2021/05/30/opinion-its-time-accept-osaka-human-being-before-athlete/5250181001/,Opinion: It's time to accept that Naomi Osaka is human before she's an athlete,"When it comes to many workplaces and issues of race and gender, there is a simple truth both inside and outside of the sports world:When white women stand up for themselves in the workplace, they are called girl bosses, queens and leaders.When women of color stand up for themselves in the workplace, they are called problematic, divas and self-serving. This truth may be unrecognizable  if you are not a woman of color, and if you are not a Black woman, this seems like an exaggerated trope.But it's not and Black women, and women of color, experience this daily. Naomi Osaka has chosen not to speak to the news media at this year’s French Open to protect her mental health, she said – an expression of standing up for herself in the workplace. Bravo to her. More:Tour, players react to Osaka: Talking to media part of jobMore:Naomi Osaka conflicted over holding the Tokyo OlympicsThis issue is, when Osaka speaks, people listen. Without her commentary at Roland Garros, the world of tennis will lose one of its most influential voices. So, fans wonder, ""Is it fair for an athlete to not do a part of their job?""But Osaka's point is that press conferences aren't just unfair, they are problematic to her mental health.“I’ve often felt that people have no regard for athletes' mental health and this rings very true whenever I see a press conference or partake in one,” Osaka said on social media.Osaka has spent years working to reach this pinnacle of her career. At just 23 she is the highest-paid female athlete in the world, earning $55 million in the past 12 months alone.But no matter how much she earns on the court, or how lucrative her multiple sponsorship deals are off of it, Osaka must stay vigilant about protecting her mental and emotional health and safeguarding her peace. Racism and sexism in the media – especially in sports media – can be far more problematic for athletes than fans know.Osaka has decided to protect herself. Good for her.""We're often sat there and asked questions that we've been asked multiple times before or asked questions that bring doubt into our mind and I'm just not Me not doing press is nothing personal to the tournament and a couple of journalists have interviewed me since I was young so I have a friendly relationship with most of them. However, if the organization thinks that they can just keep saying, 'do press or you're gonna be fined,' and continue to ignore the mental health of athletes that are the centerpiece of their cooperation that I just gotta laugh.It's time to accept that Osaka is a human being before she's an athlete.Stepping away from the things that do not serve as an essential practice for your well-being, regardless of how mandatory society makes those things, is smart, not problematic. The WTA's statement responding to Osaka shows the organization seems to only partially understand what Osaka is saying.""Mental health is of the utmost importance to the WTA (Women's Tennis Association) and for that matter, every individual person,"" the WTA said Friday. ""We have a team of professionals and a support system in place that look after our athletes' mental and emotional health and well-being. The WTA welcomes a dialogue with Naomi (and all players) to discuss possible approaches that can help support an athlete as they manage any concerns related to mental health, while also allowing us to deliver upon our responsibility to the fans and the public. Professional athletes have a responsibility to their sport and their fans and to the media surrounding their competition, allowing them the opportunity to share their perspective and tell their story.""What the WTA doesn't seem to understand is that prevention is often better than a cure.In a now-deleted tweet, the official Twitter account of Roland Garros — where the tournament is being held — posted a photo of other athletes participating in their media responsibilities on Saturday with the caption ""they understood the assignment."" Taking subliminal shots at Osaka on social media further proves the unhealthy relationship between certain athletes and the media. The incident showed that Osaka does not have the luxury of taking a stance that will ultimately protect her. Even Roland Garros doesn't get it. The immeasurable pressure society places on women of color to be strong and courageous under any and all circumstances is tiresome, yet Osaka has played some of her best tennis this past year, fulfilling media responsibilities with grace, all while gaining significant recognition for her activism. She gave victims of fatal racial bias and police brutality a global platform. Osaka is expected to be fined $140,000 but to her it's worth it.""I hope the considerable amount that I get fined for this,"" she said, ""will go towards a mental health charity."" She gets it.Contact Analis Bailey at aabailey@usatoday.com or on Twitter @analisbailey.",author,date

The NHL's Player Safety department said it would conduct a hearing for Reaves for roughing/unsportsmanlike conduct. Graves was down on the ice for several minutes, but was able to skate to the dressing room.""Reaves is on a mission to go out and hurt somebody in the third (period), and that's what he goes out and does,"" said Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog.Reaves was suspended one game for a hit to the head in last year's playoffs and was suspended for three games for boarding in 2016.Janmark, who scored a hat trick for the Golden Knights in their Game 7 victory against the Minnesota Wild, didn't return to the game after he was hit by Graves in the second period.Graves received a two-minute minor for interference on the play.Vegas coach Peter DeBoer called that hit dirty and said he had no update on Janmark.""It's hard not to carry that emotion through the rest of the game,"" he said.The incidents marred a dominant win by the rested Avalanche, who had swept the St. Louis Blues in the first round. Goalie Robin Lehner was a surprise starter for Vegas after DeBoer opted to rest Marc-Andre Fleury, who had started all seven games against Minnesota. Lehner made his first start since May 10.The line of Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen scored five goals, and defenseman Cale Makar had a four-point game.""There's a lot of things we need to improve going forward, and we're fortunate to have two days between games here,"" said Golden Knights captain Mark Stone.",author,date

https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2021/05/31/zidane-says-he-quit-because-of-lack-of-support-from-madrid/44850545/,"Former coach Zinedine Zidane blasts Real Madrid, says he quit because of lack of support","MADRID (AP) — Zinedine Zidane left Real Madrid because he didn’t feel he had the support or respect he deserved from the club, the coach said in an open letter to fans on Monday.In his first public comments since quitting last week, Zidane said the club didn’t fully value his work and hinted it leaked information to the media to undermine him. The Frenchman said he wished his relationship with president Florentino Pérez had been different in recent months.Zidane left a year before the end of his contract in his second stint with the Spanish club. The stint began in March 2019 and ended with Madrid finishing the season without a title for the first time since 2009-10.It was a completely different farewell from when he left the first time after leading Madrid to one of its most successful runs from 2016-18, when the club won three consecutive Champions League titles. He went out on top then, saying the club needed someone fresh at the helm to keep winning.“Things are different now,” Zidane said in a long letter published by the Spanish sports daily As. “I’m leaving because I feel the club no longer gives me the confidence that I need, it does not offer me the support to build something in the medium or long term.”The 48-year-old Zidane, who won nine titles in his first stint with Madrid and two in his second, said he deserved more recognition from the club for his work. He said “what we achieved together has to be respected.“I know football and I know the demands of a club like Madrid. I know that when you don’t win you have to go,” he said. “But this time something very important has been forgotten, everything that I have built on a daily basis has been forgotten, what I have contributed in the relationship with the players and with the 150 people who work at the club.”Zidane said “in a way he felt reproached” by the club for trying to work on those relationships.“I was born a winner and I was here to win trophies, but beyond this there are human beings, emotions, life... And I feel that these things have not been valued, that it wasn't understood that those things are also important for a great club,” he said.Zidane said he will always be grateful to Pérez for bringing him to Madrid and fighting for him, but he wished his relationship with the president and the club was different in recent months. He said he deserved to be treated better.“I wasn’t asking for privileges, of course not, but for some memory,"" Zidane said. ""These days coaches don’t often stay more than two seasons with a top club. For that to change, human relationships are essential, they are more important than money, more important than fame, more important than everything.”He said it “hurt a lot” to constantly read in the media that he was in danger of being fired.“It hurt me and it hurt the squad,” he said, “because these messages that were intentionally leaked to the media created negative interference within the team.”Zidane said he wished journalists would have focused their questions more on soccer than on controversy.“I wished we could have talked more about the ball and the players, who will always be the most important thing in this game,” he said. “We have to take care of football.”Madrid said after Zidane’s departure on Thursday that it respected his decision and expressed its “gratitude for his professionalism, dedication and passion over the years and what he means to Real Madrid."" The club said Zidane ”is aware that he has a place in the hearts of the Real Madrid fans and that he will always have a home at Real Madrid.”The club has yet to announce a replacement for Zidane, with Antonio Conte, Mauricio Pochettino, Xabi Alonso and Raúl González among the possible candidates for the job.",author,date
https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2021/05/30/brooklyn-nets-big-3-had-record-scoring-night-cruising-past-celtics/5278345001/,"Brooklyn Nets get an A+ on their chemistry test, cruise to easy NBA playoff win over Celtics","Remember the storyline that the Brooklyn Nets might struggle in the postseason as the chemistry among their All-Star trio develops? Well, never mind.The Nets defeated the short-handed Boston Celtics, 141-126, with Kevin Durant (42), Kyrie Irving (39) and James Harden (23) combining for 104 points. And Harden added a career playoff-high 18 assists as the Celtics took a 3-1 series lead over the Celtics.With Durant, Irving and Harden playing just eight games together in the regular season, it might seem that the Nets would need some time to figure out how to best complement each other – even as they downplayed such talk.Irving rebounded from a poor-shooting Game 3 loss by hitting 6 of his 12 3-pointers. After the game, a fan threw a water bottle at him as he left the court.“Mental toughness? One of the best I’ve ever seen. For him, all the emotions or whatever is going through his mind, which I’m sure a million things go through his mind,” Harden said of Irving. “He goes out there, blocks everything out and just (is) himself and from a guy that probably would say he didn’t play his best game in Game 3, came in and had a killer instinct, killer mentality, and had a will to win Game 4. It showed. He was aggressive, and when Kai’s aggressive like that, nobody can guard him. That gives our team energy as well. Big-time effort from him, big-time effort from our team.”It helps that they are playing a short-handed Celtics team missing Jaylen Brown (out for the playoffs, wrist surgery) and Kemba Walker (out for Game 4 with left knee bone bruise).Durant is averaging 34.7 points, Harden is averaging 26.2 and Irving is at 24.7.The 104 points scored by Durant, Irving and Harden tied an NBA playoff record for three teammates set by Boston's John Havlicek, Jo Jo White and Dave Cowens in 1973 and matched in 1986 by Dominique Wilkins, Randy Whitman and Spud Webb.State of the series: Nets lead 3-1. Game 5 is Tuesday in Brooklyn (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT)Clippers 106, Mavericks 81The Clippers claimed there was no reason to panic after they were swept in the first two games of this playoff series at home. It appears they were right. The Clippers are showing the kind of resilience expected of a title contender by overpowering the Mavericks from the start to even up their series. Kawhi Leonard led the way with 29 points on an efficient 11 of 15 shooting. And suddenly, the Clippers may have revived their title-contender status. At the very least, they regained home-court advantage. “We’re where we were supposed to be,” said Nicolas Batum. “We're supposed to be at 2-2, technically. So we're going to go home and have to take care of home court.” Mavericks star Luka Doncic, who had 19 points on 9 of 24 shooting, was certainly “in pain,” coach Rick Carlisle said, after he played through a strained neck for a second consecutive game.State of the series: Series tied 2-2. Game 5 is Wednesday in Los Angeles (10 p.m. ET, TNT)Hawks 113, Knicks 96It’s easy to think of the Hawks as a solo act. Trae Young is clearly their leader, but their supporting cast isn’t bad, either. John Collins contributed 22 points and Danilo Gallinari added 20 to support Young’s 27 points to help the Hawks take a 3-1 series lead. The Hawks have a chance to advance out of the first round of the postseason for the first time since 2016. “We have so many guys who are skilled with the basketball,” Collins said. “We have great chemistry with each other. I think the sky's the limit with this team when we do the right things.”State of the series: Hawks lead 3-1. Game 5 is Wednesday in New York (Time TBD)Suns 100, Lakers 92The Phoenix Suns got even Sunday. With stifling defense and balanced offense, coupled with Anthony Davis missing the second half with a groin injury and Chris Paul playing his best ball since injuring his right shoulder in Game 1. “The playoffs bring you to your limits in a lot of ways and that's how you grow,” Suns coach Monty Williams said. “You're watching our young team grow on the fly.” With Davis out and Paul looking more like himself in posting a team-high 18 points, nine assists and zero turnovers in 32 minutes, Phoenix returns home with huge momentum for Tuesday's Game 5 at Phoenix Suns Arena.--- Duane RankinState of the series: Series tied 2-2. Game 5 is Tuesday in Phoenix (10 p.m. ET TNT)NBA PLAYOFF SCHEDULE:First-round matchups, results, game times and TV infoWizards vs. SixersJoel Embiid has been the dominant force and is easily having the best postseason of his career. That is why the Sixers, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, have a chance to sweep their first playoff series since 1991 when they beat the Milwaukee Bucks 3-0. Embiid had a career playoff-high 36 points on 18 shots in Game 3. “I can’t imagine anybody playing better than him,” Wizards coach Scott Brooks. As a result, the Sixers definitely have a sweep on their mind. “We want to get the sweep so we can get some rest,” 76ers guard Ben Simmons said. “But this is a tough team. You never know what you are going to get every night, especially with [Bradley] Beal and [Russell] Westbrook. So we’ve got to come prepared on Monday.”State of the series: Sixers lead 3-0. Game 4 is Monday in Washington (7 p.m. ET, TNT)Jazz vs. GrizzliesThe last time the Grizzlies were in the postseason, Mike Conley was one of the main reasons they got there. In their first trip back since 2017, Conley might be one of the main reasons for their early exit. The former face of the Grit and Grind Grizzlies that made seven straight trips to the postseason, Conley is having the kind of success in Utah that he had in Memphis. And that is good news for the No. 1 Jazz. He has averaged 23 points against the Grizzlies, helping the Jazz to a 2-1 series lead. “Mike was terrific on both ends of the floor. He was Mike Conley,” Donovan Mitchell said after Game 3. “And he always has been for us all year, and he's taken it to an even another level. And I feel like when you have a guy like that who can handle the ball, who can control the game, as well, it makes my life and my job easier. So when I get certain shots, it's because he sees things, he's communicating that with me or he's putting me in positions to go ahead and score and make plays too. A lot of that too is Mike Conley being here. He's big time.”State of the series: Jazz lead 2-1. Game 4 is Monday in Memphis (9:30 p.m. ET, TNT)Blazers vs. Nuggets If you study a box score of a Trail Blazers game and discover that Damian Lillard shoots 1 of 10 from the field, there wouldn’t be much expectation of a successful outcome for Portland. But Lillard had just 10 points in Game 3, and the Blazers defeated the Nuggets 115-95. Norman Powell, who won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019, picked up the slack. Powell led the Blazers with 29 points to help the Blazers even the series. If he continues to play well and Lillard rebounds, the Blazers could make make trouble for the Nuggets. “I love these types of games, these kinds of moments.

Not that Fleury might have been able to slow down the onslaught by the rested Avalanche, who got five goals from their top line, but he did shut out Colorado twice this season.But rest for Fleury was the reason behind the move.""(Fleury) had just played seven games in 14 days and an emotional Game 7,"" Golden Knights coach Peter DeBoer said. ""It was a perfect opportunity, in our minds, to use our other starter. That’s been a strength of ours all year.""GOLDEN KNIGHTS:Ryan Reaves receives match penalty for injuring Avalanche's Ryan GravesFleury flourished this season while Lehner was out with a concussion, but after his return, the two alternated starts. Together, they won the Williams Jennings Trophy for lowest team goals-against average.Fleury excelled in the playoffs, and his 1.71 goals-against average and .931 save percentage topped his regular-season numbers (1.98, .928). Lehner, who also won the Jennings Trophy with the New York Islanders in 2018-19, went 2.29, .913 in the regular season.DeBoer figured he might have to use Lehner at some point in the playoffs, and this was a good time. Even with the blowout loss, the Golden Knights trail the series by one game and have two days off to make corrections before Game 2 on Wednesday.The coach is not second-guessing his decision.""The game tonight wasn’t about Robin Lehner,"" DeBoer said. ""We obviously didn’t play well in front on him.""Hurricanes expect goalie to bounce backThe Tampa Bay Lightning's 2-1 victory against the Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday came down to two things.Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy was brilliant, and on one shot, Hurricanes netminder Alex Nedeljkovic wasn't.""There’s no use hiding it. ... It was a bad goal,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said of Barclay Goodrow's go-ahead goal with 7:21 left in the third period. ""He’s going to admit it. It happens.""Goodrow beat the goalie short side from a bad angle.""The puck had eyes obviously, but good things happen when you shoot the puck,"" Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman said.Goodrow said he wasn't even looking to score on the play.""I was just looking to get the puck on net to create a rebound for (Yanni Gourde) and it just found a way to go in,"" he said.Brind'Amour said Nedeljkovic also made a lot of good saves and predicts he'll bounce back in Game 2.""We got to score more than one (goal) to win anyway,"" he said.The Hurricanes carried play through a lot of the game, but Vasilevskiy finished with 37 saves. He's expected to pick up his second Vezina Trophy when awards winners are announced later in the playoffs.""He’s the best in the world,"" Brind'Amour said.

Ford's 'Somebody's Daughter'","In “Sonny’s Blues,” James Baldwin tells readers that there is no way not to suffer; the goal, Baldwin says, is not to drown in suffering. Recently, Hanif Abdurraqib dropped off a collection of essays showing how everyday acts of Black performance such as dancing, joking and singing shape American culture. Adding to this 14K Cuban link chain of coping mechanisms is Ashley C. Ford’s freshman publication, “Somebody’s Daughter: A Memoir” (Flatiron, 224 pp., ★★★ out of four).Ford’s story takes place inside a humble apartment in Fort Wayne, Indiana. While love and playfulness were integral to her family's structure, behind the levity lived the matron’s wrath. Ford’s mother’s style of parenting could be viewed as child abuse. “My mother kicked me, I did not cry,” Ford writes. Although Ford never accuses her mother of abuse, there is a degree of emotional abuse present throughout the narrative. For instance, Ford’s first time getting her hair relaxed caused her young body to freeze under the pressure of her mother’s forceful hands. “I choked, spit, and finally cleared an airway enough to yell, ‘Mama.’ She did not comfort me or apologize. She stared back and said, ‘stop being dramatic,’” Ford writes.'Everybody deserves a happy ending':The gay royal romance novel is having a moment: 'Everybody deserves a happy ending'“Somebody’s Daughter” is smoothly written and marked by moments of alert complexity. Ford borrows from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston — especially Hurston’s juxtaposition of happiness to intimacy with the sun. Ford finds happiness in watching the sunrise. “I want a sunrise, and so it shall be was the natural truth in my child mind, and I did not let go,” Ford writes. Reaching for the sun is one of the few performances, and safe spaces, Ford uses to circumvent a fragmented relationship with her mother.The emotional distance separating Ford from her mother was compounded by her father’s absence. Ford’s father, whom for years she only knew through letters and family stories, served a lengthy prison sentence for rape. Between the crevices of Ford’s fractured family, she sought healing through romantic relationships with men, placing herself in a bigger sea of toxicity, and describes her sexual assault at the hands of an ex-boyfriend.Despite being incarcerated, Ford’s father was the one person – next to her grandmother – who provided Ford with the sunrise she desperately reached for. In letters, her father wrote to her that she was beautiful and brilliant. “For a long time that was all I needed until of course, I needed more,” Ford writes.Over the years, Ford perfected the skill of suppressing her feelings. “Feeling any of it felt like the beginning of losing control, and losing control felt like a certain death in my body. If I didn’t process the feeling, I wouldn’t feel it,” Ford writes. Again, it was Ford’s father who encouraged her to unshackle her comfort from the moods of others. “Just tell your truth,” her father said. “Don’t worry about nobody’s feelings, especially not mine.  You gotta be tough to tell your truth, but it’s the only thing worth doing next to loving somebody.”“Somebody’s Daughter” is a thoughtful debut. Ford writes with a flush and sophisticated pen. But the heartbeat of Ford’s firstborn is her ability to pinpoint critical moments on her self-discovering journey, and, like Baldwin and Abdurraqib, find respectable ways to perform and not drown in her suffering.Review:Hanif Abdurraqib's 'A Little Devil in America' examines acts of joy in Black performance",author,date

But the kind of knowledge and information that is required to be a ""Jeopardy!""-level champion is very, very specific. And I have specificity in neuroscience and in how to be a sitcom actress, but this is a different kind of fandom. Q: And when the opportunity to host came along, how did you react?Bialik: Oh, I lost my mind, and really am still losing my mind. This is one of the most iconic things that I can be part of in my life. Of all the things I've done, of all the acting I've done, of all the advocacy I've done, and all my academic things, this is the most globally understood, absolutely incredible thing to be part of. It's unbelievable.Q: So it sounds like you jumped at the chance to host.Bialik: I was so grateful. There were a few snafus in terms of scheduling and COVID. Part of our industry was shut down after Thanksgiving, and I was so nervous that I would lose my slotted dates. To do this also knowing the importance and significance after Alex passed away (and) really honoring this brand and this show was so important to me.That was before I even got there, and then my experience of actually filming was so incredibly gratifying, and I don't really know how to explain it other than to say it really felt like being home. It felt like these are my people, the way that the show is run, the way that that we understand the material and how to move through this show it just felt really, really natural, and it was terrific. I cried. I cried after my two days there. I didn’t want to leave. More 'Jeopardy!':'It's the most emotional Tournament of Champions you'll see'Who will bethe next 'Jeopardy!' host? Everything we know about the searchQ: Did you experience any nerves on your first day?Bialik: I was terrified (laughs). It's not like you can even try to fill Alex's shoes. Everybody kind of holds his energy present on that stage. You still feel him there, and I think I really just wanted to discreetly and humbly take that podium.Every episode moves so quickly, and your job as host is not to mess up, meaning not to read the clue and then re-read it if you stumble. It's a very specific and well-oiled machine. I was nervous the whole time, but it was nervous excitement, and once I kind of got into a rhythm it felt more natural, and I felt like I was able to ad-lib a little bit more. But (I) was coached through the things that Alex did that we like to protect and be as little of a nuisance as possible. Q: What are some of the things that Alex did that they wanted to protect?Bialik: Alex was about the economy of words, meaning you don't need to have a full dialogue every time someone gets something correct or incorrect. And part of that is really respecting the timing of the show. It's a lot of clues to get through (61), and you don't have time to be adorable. You don't have time to ad-lib a ton. So really finding the least number of words to communicate where we're at in the show and what's coming up, that's really what I tried to hone. Q: What was the most challenging part of hosting?Bialik: Reading words in languages that I don’t speak. There's a lot of clues about things in history that I don't know about. I don't know how to pronounce the lakes of Africa off the top of my head. Alex spoke French. It’s a language I do not speak, but there definitely were a lot of clues in French, and I kind of pronounced (things) like a trucker. So definitely had to re-record a lot of pronunciation stuff.'No one else has lobbied':'Jeopardy!' producer on how LeVar Burton won his audition spot'Jeopardy!' producer reveals LeVar Burton phone calls that led to guest host spotQ: Would you want to be considered as a permanent replacement?Bialik: There's not any answer that doesn't include yes! Look, I'm on social media, I see what happens. I will say that for me personally, and academically speaking, this is a really, really, really lovely place that I felt so comfortable, and was really honored to be part of it in any way. But obviously feel very strongly that if people find me tolerable, this is a dream job.Q: Do you have a favorite thing about Alex Trebek's hosting style, or is there something that you miss?Bialik: There's a reason that he had the success and longevity that he did. He was the perfect combination of authority and host and friend, and also, from what I've heard, an incredibly generous and lovely man.Q: And you've selected the National Alliance on Mental Illness as your charity. (A donation matching the cumulative winnings during a star's turn as guest host will be made to their selected organization.) Why did you pick that charity?Bialik: I've been involved with that charity as a client, as it were. They provide support not only to individuals living with mental illness, but to their families as well, to give support to help people get through understanding that the family member is struggling or hospitalized or living with a mental illness. And I started a mental health podcast, actually, over COVID (Mayim Bialik's Breakdown), and so that's really been where most of my time and energy has been (directed), helping get the word out about organizations like NAMI that provide support.",author,date

Tips for calling out family and friends in personAmnesty International suggests using ""I"" statements when confronting a family member or friend. ""Rather than saying ‘You’re a racist,’ talk about how those comments are impacting you and how you are feeling about it,” their website states. They also suggest clarifying the other person's stance, talking to them quietly and not getting too aggressive, which may lessen the effectiveness of you ""persuasive powers.""52. Tips for calling out family and friends onlineAmnesty International has a couple of suggestions for dealing with racists online, which include ""Deleting or blocking them,"" ""sharing a link that explains the holes in their views"" or ""taking a similar approach to the tips above for real-life conversations.""53. Influence people in your groupIt's great to call people out on racist comments, but don't stop there. You can also preemptively help educate others by talking to people in your own life about how systems of oppression affect marginalized groups.54. Demand change from brandsYour wallet can be your power when it comes to taking action. For-profit brands need customers to make revenue, so using your purchasing power and your platform on social media and with reviews are ways to push brands into enacting change you would like to see.55. Question the media outlets you readAre media outlets sharing statements of solidarity but not actually contributing to diverse newsrooms? As readers, you can question and share your opinions and concerns on the content provided. Sharing job postings and internship opportunities within your communities also helps give more people the chance to make their voices part of a larger outlet.56. Understand privilege""It is also important, as white people, for us to remember that we will never 'get it.' We are all subject to racist ideas and we will never fully understand the experience of our Black community members, no matter how much we read, study, think or learn, or how many Black friends we have, or even if we have Black romantic partners or children,"" Taylor said.57. Question yourself about privilegeIn order to understand privilege, you can ask yourself questions. For example, were you ever called names because of your race, class, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation? Also consider your own possible racial biases, which may be implicit even though you think you are being open-minded. 58. Actively acknowledge and support members of the LGBTQ+ communitiesPart of the movements and protests is to create space for all marginalized people to share their voices, especially for Black people who also identify as LGBTQ+. Making space, amplifying those voices and defending people in LGBTQ+ communities is multifaceted, whether that's having honest conversations with those closest to you or supporting organizations and brands that provide safe spaces.59. Do the research ""It is equally vital that all of us, and white folks, in particular, do the ongoing personal work to read and educate ourselves on the ways that racism shows up in our own lives, neighborhoods, schools, and communities,"" Taylor said. Research your state's civil rights history to be better informed about your community's legacy and racial roots.60. Avoid being silent“Particularly white people who want to be allies, stop it, call it out. Say, ‘That’s not funny.’ Silence looks a lot like complicity,"" Associate Professor of Criminal Justice, Director of the Center for Advanced Policing and Assistant Provost of Diversity and Inclusion at the University of New Haven Lorenzo Boyd told USA TODAY. ""You have to physically say, 'That’s not cool, you can’t say that.’ “61. Accept you'll make mistakes and apologize""Recognize that you might mess up, and if you do, apologize sincerely, and keep learning and growing,"" Taylor said. Be mindful of questioning something considered prejudiced or racist. Doing so does not promote discussion, but instead undermines historic personal pain.62. Avoid commenting on character traits“I can’t change my eyes or my hair or my skin color, or to some extent my weight or my height, so things that are physical traits or character traits, we shouldn’t be commenting on. We can talk about behavior,"" Boyd says. For example, we no longer say, “She’s just blond. Or, she’s having a blond moment,"" Boyd explains.63. Don't perform antiracism ""For my white friends and colleagues, in particular, I think it is really important for us to be sure we are not performing antiracism,"" Taylor explained. ""Antiracism and allyship are not badges or identities, or about woke-looking T-shirts or passionate posts on social media. Rather, antiracism is a series of intentional and ongoing actions.""Support Black-owned businesses64. Actively seek out Black businesses to supportThe first way to support Black-owned businesses is to actively work on finding and frequenting them.

Boyd says political action is another vital part in taking action. “Going to the polls,” he explained. “White America just by the numbers has a lot more voting power and a lot more political power than Black America does, so to have white America agree to levels of accountability for politicians” is important.94. Be aware of overt versus covert racismBoyd explains that overt is direct, “over-the-top, in your face” racism, whereas covert or “hidden” racism looks like microaggressions. For example, “Wow, you’re amazingly articulate for a Black guy.”“The covert racism I think could be more problematic. When people are overtly racist, we see them. I see the guy wearing the KKK outfit,"" Boyd explains. ""The covert racism often masks itself as, ‘We’re friends but when you’re not here …’ (so it’s) a false sense of security.”Taylor added, ""As white people, we don’t have to have active feelings of hate in our hearts in order to be engaging in racist behavior. Even when we have good intentions, we can still cause racial harm. In other words, we don’t have to be 'bad people' to be engaging in racism.""95. Educate yourself by readingReading novels, nonfiction and children's books by Black authors can help educate people on Black history and experiences. There are also books that specifically lift up Black female voices as well as help children understand race. To see a full list of book suggestions, click here.96. Educate yourself with podcastsSupport Black-run podcasts such as “Earn Your Leisure” and ""ForAllNerds."" There are also podcasts that specifically focus on race, including “About Race,” “Momentum: A Race Forward Podcast” and “Intersectionality Matters!”97.

""Little Fires Everywhere"" on Hulu and ""Watchmen"" on HBO both weave race and generational inherited trauma into their tales of justice. For lighter fare, Issa Rae's HBO comedy ""Insecure"" shares a slice-of-life look at a group of Black women in Los Angeles and their triumphs and struggles.

Be mindful of images you’re sharing online “There is vicarious trauma in the Black community,” Boyd said. “And it’s not my family, it’s not my person that’s being killed, but over and over again when people of color turn on the TV or open up social media … and they see Black pain, that hurts a little bit more.""He continued, “So in order for us to let people get over this trauma, we need to stop sharing it as much as we do. I’m not talking censoring, people have a right to see, but the people who share it because of its shock value.”100.

The following contains details from Sunday's finale of ""Mare of Easttown,"" ""Sacrament.""It was always about mothers and sons. In the final episode of HBO's great ""Mare of Easttown,"" a murder mystery set in a small town near Philadelphia, Detective Mare Sheehan (Kate Winslet) found out who really killed Erin McMenamin (Cailee Spaeny). But the miniseries was always about more than unmasking a murderer. ""Sacrament"" was alternately calm and tense, a twisty hour thatmay havelulled some viewers into thinking the killer was arrested in the first few minutes, only to reveal the truth later. The installment was a master class in full-circle storytelling – there are no plot holes in ""Mare,"" even when it comes to a security camera at an elderly neighbor's house – without seeming too tidy. As Mare eventually discovers, Erin was killed not by John Ross (Joe Tippett) – the father of her son D.J. – who confessed early in the finale. Instead, the culprit was John's angry son Ryan (Cameron Mann), who didn't want Erin breaking up his family. Ryan also happens to be the son of Mare's best friend Lori (Julianne Nicholson). So Mare, still reeling from the death of her own son by suicide, takes another boy away from his mother. What ""Mare"" does so well in the finale – which HBO's ""The Undoing,"" last year's similarly star-studded crime drama, completely failed to do – is subvert expectations without exploitative shocks. Ryan as the killer is a surprising twist that also makes sense and satisfies. It explains why Billy (Robbie Tann) and John made false confessions; why Ryan had a violent outburst at school; and what secret John wanted him to keep from Lori.  More than that, it serves the greater story about Mare, her late son and her relationships with family and friends in Easttown. In a lesser series or with a lesser actress, the sentimental ending could have been hokey and trite. But Winslet and creator Brad Inglesby pull it off. More:How to watch 'Mare of Easttown'The episode picks up right where last week's left off, as Mare pursues John and Billy at their fishing cabin while Chief Carter (John Douglas Thompson) desperately tries to reach her after seeing a revealing photograph of Erin in bed with John. John was having sex with the teen daughter of his cousin. Carter can't get in touch with Mare, who finds John holding his brother at gunpoint. Mare intervenes and arrests John. Back at the police station, John confesses everything – sleeping with (and killing) Erin and being D.J.'s father. He says Erin brought the gun to their meeting, and after it accidentally discharged and hit her hand, he grabbed it and shot her. He also says he enlisted Billy to help him move the body to Sharp's Woods, hoping to incriminate one of the teens at the party, which explains Billy's bloody clothes the night of the murder. The episode has barely started and it seems the mystery is already wrapped up, along with several other major plot threads. Lori takes custody of D.J. (and D.J. finally gets his ear surgery in her care). Deacon Mark (James McArdle), who was in jail on suspicion of involvement in Erin's death, is released.In the weeks that follow, Carrie (Sosie Bacon) gives up her custody case for Mare's grandson Drew (Izzy King), admitting that she has started using drugs again. Frank (David Denman) and Faye (Kate Arrington) get back together and plan their wedding. Mare and her mother Helen (Jean Smart) settle some unresolved issues. Everything seems right as a hoagie from Wawa until Mare bumps into the other woman with whom John was supposedly having an affair during the police investigation. She emphatically tells Mare that she and John haven't slept together in years, which is the first crack in John's story.  Later, when Mare visits Mr. Carroll (Patrick McDade) after he complains about a petty theft, she discovers his gun – the same kind that was used to kill Erin – went missing for a few hours on the day she was murdered. Mare consults his security camera footage and sees Ryan sneak into the back shed and take the gun. More:The 10 best new TV shows to watch this summer: 'Sweet Tooth,' Stephen King and Steve MartinAfter she arrests Ryan, we finally get the full story. Ryan knew about John and Erin's relationship the whole time, and was afraid his parents would get divorced. He confronted Erin at the park with the stolen gun, and she tried to take it away. During the struggle, she was shot twice. He told his father what he did, and John and Billy moved the body. After Ryan is sent to juvenile detention, weeks pass. Richard (Guy Pearce), who turned out to be a nice guy and not a sleeper murder suspect, leaves for a new job. Siobhan (Angourie Rice) goes to college in California. Mare continues her therapy, as her psychologist asks if she's ready to confront her grief now that she's solved all these crimes. Eventually, Mare visits Lori and their bond is silently mended, as Lori collapses, sobbing, in Mare's arms. The finale ends with Mare, having mostly repaired her relationships, finally visiting the attic in her house where her son died by suicide.It's a fitting ending for ""Mare,"" which was always a story far more interested in exploring grief than solving a mystery-solving. Anything else would have been too cheap. More:The best TV shows of 2021 (so far), from ‘Girls5Eva’ to ‘Mare of Easttown’",author,date
https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/05/30/memorial-day-weekend-quiet-place-sequel-nabs-box-office-covid-best/5274881001/,Memorial Day weekend at the movies: 'A Quiet Place Part II' collects box office pandemic-best,"NEW YORK — Moviegoing increasingly looks like it didn’t die during the pandemic. It just went into hibernation.John Krasinski’s thriller sequel “A Quiet Place Part II” opened over the Memorial Day weekend to a pandemic-best $48.4 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. Including the Monday holiday, the studio forecasts the film will gross $58.5 million in North America. It added another $22 million in ticket sales overseas.The film’s performance cheered a movie industry that has been punished and transformed by the pandemic. Paramount Pictures’ “A Quiet Place Part II,” which was on the cusp of opening in March 202 before theaters shut, was the first big film this year — and one of the only larger budget COVID-era releases beside Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” — to open exclusively in theaters.Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount, called the opening “an unqualified success.”“It’s a huge sigh of a relief and a sense of optimism for sure,” Aronson said. “Movies, moviegoing, movie theaters aren’t dead. Yes, they’ve been threatened but they’re proving once again that they’re resilient and that people do want to have that communal experience.”Review:'A Quiet Place Part II' roars back as a solidly freaky, monster-filled followupMany studios have trotted out hybrid release plans during the pandemic, debuting films simultaneously in the home. The Walt Disney Co. did that this weekend with its live-action PG-13 Cruella De Vil prequel, “Cruella,” making it available to Disney+ subscribers for $30. In theaters, it grossed $21.3 million, Disney said, and an estimated $26.4 million over the four-day weekend. “Cruella” also added $16.1 million in 29 international territories. Disney didn’t say how much the film made on the company’s streaming platform.“A Quiet Place II” will also turn to streaming after 45 days in theaters when it becomes available on Paramount+. One clear result of the pandemic is that the theatrical window has shrunk, probably permanently. Three months was once the customary length of a movie’s run in theaters. The year’s previous best debut belonged to Warner Bros.′ “Godzilla vs. Kong,” which opened with $32.2 million, or $48.5 million over its first five days, while simultaneously streaming on HBO Max.The contrasting release strategies between “A Quiet Place Part II” and “Cruella” offered a test case for Hollywood. How much does a day-and-date release cost a movie like “Cruella” in ticket sales? Is it worth it? Without knowing how much “Cruella” benefitted Disney+, a true comparison isn’t possible. But the strong returns for the theater-only “A Quiet Place Part II” are telling, says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. He called it a “pivotal weekend” for the movie industry that proved predictions of the movie theater’s demise “flat-out wrong.”“That ‘Quiet Place Part II’ did so well makes a strong case that a theatrical-first release for a big movie is the way to go,” Dergarabedian said. “This is the best possible news for an industry that’s been dealing with probably the most profoundly challenging chapter in the history of the movie theater.”The debut of “A Quiet Place Part II” was much watched throughout Hollywood as the kickoff to its delayed summer movie season. After largely sitting out the pandemic, or diverting to streaming platforms, a lineup of blockbusters are again queuing up. On tap are Warner Bros.′ “In the Heights,” Universals’ “F9” and Disney’s “Black Widow.”Last week, Universal Pictures’ ninth installment in the “Fast & Furious” franchise, “F9,” opened with $162 million in ticket sales in eight international markets, and $135 million in China alone. In its second weekend, “F9,” which opens in North America on June 25, raced toward $230 million worldwide.“A Quiet Place Part II” had already had its red-carpet premiere in March last year, and spent some of its marketing budget. But it opened remarkably in line with predictions of how many tickets it would sell before the onset of the pandemic. In the intervening months, Paramount sold off many of its films to streamers — “Coming 2 America,” “The Trial of the Chicago 7” — but Krasinski and the studio felt strongly that the hushed intensity of “A Quiet Place Part II” worked best on the big screen.'Did I just put my marriage on the line?':John Krasinski recounts the scariest scene in 'Quiet Place II' for Emily BluntIn an interview ahead of the film’s release, Krasinski said a theatrical release was “non-negotiable.” And Krasinski worked hard to stoke excitement, traveling the country in the week leading up to release to surprise moviegoers. Still, given the circumstances, he had little idea whether audiences would come out.“As bizarre as the entire year has been is how bizarre whatever opening weekend is,” Krasinski said. “I don’t really know what it is anymore.”In the end, “A Quiet Place Part II” performed a lot like how the first one did. That 2018 hit, which ultimately grossed $340 million globally on a $17 million budget, launched with $50.2 million in North American ticket sales. Sequels usually do better than the original but “Part II” had far more challenges due to pandemic.Rich Gelfond, chief executive of IMAX, where “A Quiet Place Part II” earned $4.1 million domestically, called the film “the first domestic release this year to cross the threshold from ‘great opening weekend given the pandemic’ to ‘great opening weekend, period.’”Memorial Day weekend, usually one of the busiest for theaters, still didn’t look like it normally does at the movies. Total box office exceeded $80 million but that’s about a third of the holiday weekend’s normal business. Last Memorial Day, when nearly all operating theaters were drive-ins, ticket sales amounted to $842,000, according to Comscore.Many theaters, particularly in New York and Los Angeles, are still operating with social distancing measures. But guidelines are thawing. Last week, the nation’s top theater chains — AMC, Regal, Cinemark — said they would no longer require vaccinated moviegoers to wear face masks.",author,date

Paul, a white guy from Pennsylvania on probation trying to restart his life, catches the eye of Wye, a trans woman of color he sees voguing on the steps of the transportation hub with friends. It’s a clash of worlds, with Paul trying to hide his problematic friends and the fact that he lives in a homeless shelter. The nuanced film also puts the LBGTQ+ subculture of the New York underground ballroom scene (and subsequently, the people of color like Wye and her friends who perform and compete at the events) at its center.Survival and forgiveness are interlocking themes for the young couple throughout the film, as Paul comes to terms with falling in love with a trans woman. ""People of color, trans people, queer people, we are just always trying to forgive people for the pain""caused to the community, says Bloom, as she Zooms in from New York City. Leyna Bloom becomes first transgender woman of color to model in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit IssueThe film made history at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019 with a trans woman of color as its lead actress and the Martin Scorsese-backed movie marked Bloom’s first major acting role. She's continued to make headlines since: In addition to her work on the final season of Ryan Murphy’s trailblazing FX series “Pose” as Pretentia Khan, Bloom,whose rep declined to share her age, is the first Black and Asian trans woman to be featured in 2021's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and her upcoming drama thriller ""Asking For It"" will premiere at Tribeca Film Festival in June. Bloom details how she relates to her character, what she hopes viewers walk away with from the movie, how she's celebrating Pride Month and more.Question: What made you want to take on the portrayal of a trans woman falling in love with an out-of-towner amid New York's ballroom scene? Leyna Bloom: It was so much like the stories I grew up hearing through the grapevine of the ballroom community. Here is a story that is not about trauma of a trans woman not being able. It was a movie about a trans woman being the center of a love story, of being something so beautiful that it could potentially change some ideas in the world.(Wye) was just like the combination of like the coolest girl that I've always wanted to be, and always wanted to see in the world. From 'Disclosure' to 'Pose':What movies, shows to watch on Trans Day of Visibility'All Boys Aren't Blue,' 'Unapologetic':The 4 best LGBTQ films we watched at Outfest Fusion 2021Q: How did you tap into your own experiences in ballroom to bring this to life?Bloom: For me, it was my responsibility. Honestly, that's what it always comes down to: my responsibility to the person that I was in ballroom, and still (am) in ballroom. Seeing so many beautiful, talented people of color thrive in their uniqueness and in their imagination and in their ability to create something with just being exactly who they want to be – that's something that always captivated me about the culture.Many are more comfortable in their bodies during the pandemic. For some LGBTQ people, it's the opposite.Q: I read that you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid. In the movie's ball scene where Paul finds out that Wye is trans, there's a space theme. What was it like to film that? Bloom: It's honestly the universe in a full circle moment for me. I wanted to be an astronaut, I wanted to go infinity and beyond. To be in a scene of astro-space odyssey, and when (Wye) walks she has this dress on with all these stars, it's a message in a message.As humans we are very nervous and afraid of what's different in the world. I know making this film there's three different groups of people in society. There's people that will love me and support me and be there for people like me. There's people that just don't want to have that conversation, don't want to be a part of that experience, don't want to explore those options. And there's people that just don't know what to think, they don't know how to respond. That's the audience that I'm trying to speak to. I'm trying to speak to people that are willing to (take) a chance to give people a chance. More:US hits record for transgender killings. Puerto Rico is the epicenter of the violenceQ: What does Pride Month mean to you at this moment in your life? Bloom: Pride is not just this time when we can explore things that are in us that we're raised to suppress and now we're taught to express it in the sun and in the streets and the world just for one month. It's something that I have to do every single day of my life. I have to wake up and be proud that I'm alive and (ask) ""Why am I here?

I don't know what they're going to say. I don't know what I'm going to say but it seems like the conversation's happening in real life,"" the 29-year-old says.One of those musical numbers is the ""satirical banger"" released May 21 ""Stop Being Poor,"" which Ziwe co-wrote with Jordan Mendoza and features comedian Patti Harrison.""It's about and it was inspired by the height of the pandemic where the government was kind of just like, 'Sorry you guys don't have any money, figure it out, good luck, bye!' "" she says. ""Like millions of Americans were like losing their homes, defaulting, and I just I don't know how to interpret people treating their citizens like that.""The song, much like the rest of the show, highlights her inherently smart use of satire. Ziwe, who cut her teeth writing for ""Desus & Mero"" and ""The Rundown with Robin Thede"" and co-hosted the Crooked Media podcast ""Hysteria,"" subverts expectations for what a late-night comedy series should look like. Ziwe shares details about the discomfort level of her interviews (""It's a constant confrontation,"" she says), her dream guest, her love of ""The Boondocks"" and more.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Question: You’ve written for other shows like “Desus & Mero” and you’ve done ""Baited,"" but what is it like to have your own show entirely?Ziwe: It's really quite a process. I think I've been doing a version of the show for years, so it's wild to have a platform where I get to scale and interview people like Gloria Steinem and Fran Lebowitz and Andrew Yang and Stacey Abrams, who's in our finale. It's just such an exciting process.Q: What inspired you to begin having these conversations about race and culture?Ziwe: I've always just had these conversations. If you're like a person of color with really awkward conversations about race, and sometimes you're like, ""Wait, I wish there was a camera and someone can see how wild this experience and this conversation is."" So ultimately, I was taking my real-life experiences and bringing them to the screen.Q: How would you describe your comedy style and the style of the show?Ziwe: It is very pink and very feminine and funny. It's a satirical comedy show. It satirizes talk shows and it's a deconstruction of the celebrity interview and I think that you see that in the way I talk to my guests as well as the fake commercials and sketches, you know fieldpiece interviews that I do with Karens or with plastic surgeons.Q: Are your guests in on the joke at all? Do you feel like they know what they're getting themselves into when they sign up for this?Ziwe: I don't know. It depends on the guest. But Fran, for example, didn't know who I was, and so that was such a fun interview because she was so honest and I really appreciated that. I'm not sure that I need my guests to know who I am. I just want to have honest conversations, but I'm never trying to trick them or deceive them. We brief them and their talent people.Q: A lot of people are very interested and waiting with bated breath for Andrew Yang's appearance on the show. What can you tease for us with that interview?Ziwe: I asked him about his controversial pro-Israel tweet, so we'll see his answer to that. He's such an iconic guest. I'll put it that way.Q: Who would you say is your dream guest and why?Ziwe: I think Kim Kardashian is my dream guest, only because she has such an interesting purview on race. I think she's one of the most famous women in American history. She and Paris Hilton sort of founded the influencer culture. And so I think that talking to her about race would be really, really compelling especially as someone who is so prominent in pop culture.Q: I feel like you've done much of the show in a timely way, like with the Karens. In terms of filming that and putting that together, what was that experience like for you?Ziwe: What I appreciated was that, ultimately, I think I left with them feeling sort of human. They weren't net good or net bad, but they were sort of complex in understanding the misunderstandings about how they perceive the world. And so that was something that I really appreciated, was just hearing people named Karen talk about the phenomenon of ""Karens"" is ridiculous. And it's inherently like absurd, and that's part of the joke, right? It says there are real Karens out there, and their voices matter, but actually taking that word seriously and elevating their words because their names are Karen becomes really interesting satire, that felt like ""60 Minutes"" or ""20/20."" Q: A lot of what I've seen from you that I appreciate and I think other people appreciate, is that so much of what we've gone through as Black people across this country in the past year – and not even just the past year, obviously – has just been traumatic, and to find moments of levity and of humor in that is kind of indicative of the Black experience in many ways in America.Ziwe: I think from I can only speak for myself, and how I process trauma is through comedy. That's the only way that I know how to heal myself, and so I hope that by the way that I process also help other people process and heal and go back into their communities, and be better people and not say stupid things and try to be more thoughtful and try to advocate for themselves. It's really quite an odd experience to be seen, to feel seen.I know that when I was growing up, I mean this stuff didn't exist right, and I probably was 14 when I saw ""Colbert Report,"" but there wasn't really like satire about the Black experience. ""Boondocks"" was something that I really gravitated toward when I was really young. But I didn't have the vocabulary to defend myself. So I'm hoping that I create art that gives people like the steps to go forward and make their own thing and be their own person.Q: You mentioned ""The Boondocks,"" but were there other pieces of comedy or pop culture you feel inspired you or helped inform your sense of humor?Ziwe: I mean ""The Colbert Report."" I think (""Ziwe"") feels like an analogue for that. It's the similar idea of like a character who approaches political issues from this like hyper-specific place, so that's an influence of mine. I never talk about how big ""The Boondocks"" was, but that is one of the most impactful texts for me because of the ways in which they dealt with race was really sort of hysterical, like crying hysterically, because it was just absurd. Riley and Huey were both so distinctly different characters, foils of each other, and the character of Rob was really, really offensive, so I really appreciated that part as well.I worked with Desus and Mero for two years. They're two of the most bombastic, wild, silly comedians that I have come into contact with and so they were huge influences for me – before I even was working with them – because they reminded me so much of where I came from in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Q: How did you come up with your question about counting 4-5 Black friends? I feel like that's kind of become part of your thing.Ziwe: People defend not being racist by saying, ""Oh I have Black friends,"" and at the height of the racial oppression during the pandemic, people were getting caught with blackface and people were abusing their staff, but (they said) ""No, it's OK, I have Black friends."" And this was a constant refrain that comes up in American media a lot, and so I wanted to really unpack it. Well, everyone is saying they have Black friends when they are accused of racism – how many Black friends you guys have? It was just me exploiting the tropes that I find to be ridiculous.",author,date

He was 90. MacLeod died early Saturday at his home in Palm Desert, California, his stepdaughter Stephanie Steele Zalin told the Associated Press. She attributed his death to his age, saying he had been well until very recently.“He had one of the most amazing, fun blasts of a life of anybody I know. He enjoyed every minute of it,” Steele Zalin said. “I don’t even think in his wildest dreams he dreamt of the life that he ended up having and creating.”She called him the “best, sweetest, purest guy.”USA TODAY has reached out to MacLeod's representatives for additional comment.MacLeod's acting career took off when he was cast alongside legendary actress Mary Tyler Moore as the news writer for the fictional ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" WJM-TV news station. With a balding head, MacLeod's character served as a foil to Betty White's happy homemaker Sue Ann Nivens. His role on the groundbreaking sitcom landed him two Golden Globe nominations for best supporting actor. B.J. Thomas dies at 78:'Hooked on a Feeling,' 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head' singer had battled lung cancer'How wrong I was':Robert Redford thought B.J. Thomas' 'Raindrops' didn't fit in 'Butch Cassidy'After his stint on ""Mary Tyler Moore"" MacLeod served as the lead character for ""The Love Boat"" sitcom. The show lasted for almost 10 years on ABC as it followed captain Merrill Stubing on the MS Pacific cruise ship. The hour-long comedy depicted fictional passengers and crew involved in adventures and romances at sea. MacLeod added three more Golden Globe nominations, this time for best actor, for his role as Stubing.More:'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' anniversary: 50 ways we still love the classic sitcomIn 2013 he released his memoir ""This Is Your Captain Speaking: My Fantastic Voyage Through Hollywood, Faith & Life"" and wrote about the highs and lows of his long-running career in show business. ""My life has taken one incredible turn after another,"" MacLeod wrote. ""I've gotten to do what I wanted to do. I've been a captain! I've been given this incredible gift of life and now I want to use it to give back. That's why I'm sharing my story here, the fun parts and even some not-so-fun parts, in the hopes that maybe someone will take a nice walk down memory lane with me – and maybe I'll even give someone a little bit of hope.""One major role he auditioned for: Archie Bunker in “All in the Family.” But he quickly realized the character, immortalized by Carroll O'Connor, was wrong for him. “Immediately I thought, ‘This is not the script for me. The character is too much of a bigot.’ I can’t say these things,” MacLeod wrote in his memoir.Other movie credits included “Kelly’s Heroes,” “The Sand Pebbles” and “The Sword of Ali Baba.”MacLeod's former ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" costar Ed Asner remembered him on Twitter on Saturday as his ""partner in crime."" ""My heart is broken. Gavin was my brother, my partner in crime (and food) and my comic conspirator. I will see you in a bit Gavin. Tell the gang I will see them in a bit,"" Asner wrote. ""Betty!

Thomas, who sang 'Hooked on a Feeling,' 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,' dies at 78","B.J. Thomas, the Grammy-winning singer who enjoyed success on the pop, country and gospel charts with such hits as ""I Just Can't Help Believing,"" ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"" and ""Hooked on a Feeling,"" has died. He was 78.Thomas, who announced in March that he had been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, died from complications of the disease Saturday at his home in Arlington, Texas, his publicist Jeremy Westby said in a statement.While he was receiving treatment in a Texas health care facility, Thomas issued a statement noting he was hopeful for a full recovery.""I just wanted to take this unique opportunity to share my gratitude to Gloria, my wonderful wife and my rock for over 53 years, my family, friends, and fans,"" he wrote.""I'm so blessed to have had the opportunity to record and perform beautiful songs in pop, country, and gospel music, and to share those wonderful songs and memories around the world with millions of you. I ask all of you for your prayers during this time and that my music can live on with you.""'How wrong I was': Robert Redford thought 'Raindrops' in 'Butch Cassidy' was 'a dumb idea'A Hugo, Oklahoma-native who grew up in Houston, Billy Joe Thomas broke through in 1966 with a gospel-styled cover of Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" and went on to sell millions of records and have dozens of hits across genres. He reached No. 1 with pop, adult contemporary and country listeners in 1976 with ""(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song."" The same year, his ""Home Where I Belong"" became one of the first gospel albums to be certified platinum for selling more than 1 million copies.His signature recording was ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,"" a No. 1 pop hit and an Oscar winner for best original song as part of the soundtrack to one of the biggest movies of 1969, the irreverent Western ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" Thomas wasn't the first choice to perform the whimsical ballad composed by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; Ray Stevens turned the songwriters down. But his warm, soulful tenor fit the song's easygoing mood, immortalized on film during the scene when Butch (Paul Newman) shows off his new bicycle to Etta Place (Katharine Ross), the girlfriend of the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford).""Raindrops"" has since been heard everywhere from ""The Simpsons"" to ""Forrest Gump"" and was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2013. But, at first, not everyone was satisfied. Thomas was recovering from laryngitis while recording the soundtrack version and his vocals are raspier than for the track released on its own. Redford, meanwhile, doubted the song even belonged in ""Butch Cassidy.""""When the film was released, I was highly critical – how did the song fit with the film? There was no rain,"" Redford told USA TODAY in 2019. ""At the time, it seemed like a dumb idea. How wrong I was.""Gavin MacLeod:'Love Boat' and 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' actor dies at 90Thomas would later say the phenomenon of ""Raindrops"" exacerbated an addiction to pills and alcohol which dated back to his teens, when a record producer in Houston suggested he take amphetamines to keep his energy up. He was touring and recording constantly and taking dozens of pills a day. By 1976, while ""(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song"" was hitting No. 1, he felt like he was ""number 1,000.""""I was at the bottom with my addictions and my problems,"" he said in 2020 on ""The Debby Campbell Goodtime Show."" He cited a ""spiritual awakening,"" shared with his wife, Gloria Richardson, with helping him to get clean.Thomas had few pop hits after the mid-1970s, but he continued to score on the country charts with such No. 1 songs as ""Whatever Happened to Old-Fashioned Love"" and ""New Looks from an Old Lover."" In the late 1970s and early '80s, he was also a top gospel and inspirational singer, winning two Dove awards and five Grammys, including a Grammy in 1979 for best gospel performance for ""The Lord's Prayer.""Fans of the 1980s sitcom ""Growing Pains"" heard him as the singer of the show's theme song. He also acted in a handful of movies, including ""Jory"" and ""Jake's Corner"" and toured often. Recent recordings included ""Living Room Music,"" featuring cameos from Lyle Lovett, Vince Gill and Richard Marx. He had planned to record in 2020 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, but the sessions were delayed because of the pandemic. Thomas married Richardson in 1968, and had three daughters: Paige, Nora and Erin. He and his wife worked on the 1982 memoir ""In Tune: Finding How Good Life Can Be."" His book ""Home Where I Belong"" came out in 1978 and was co-authored by Jerry B. Jenkins, later famous for the million-selling ""Left Behind"" religious novels written with Tim LaHaye.Speaking to the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, in 2019, Thomas reflected on the prospect of retiring from music one day. ""If I reach a point where I don't feel like I'm performing as well, I guess that could happen,"" he said. ""I am getting older; it's inevitable my throat is aging as well. Maybe there will come a time at some point, but you know as long as I'm really having fun and I still do have a major motivation to do it, I just want to do it.""'School of Rock' drummer Kevin Clark dies at 32:Jack Black, Miranda Cosgrove share tributesBesides music, Thomas loved baseball as a kid and started calling himself B.J. because so many Little League teammates also were named Billy Joe. By his teens, he was singing in church and had joined a local rock band, the Triumphs, whom he would stay with into his 20s. He enjoyed Ernest Tubbs, Hank Williams and other country performers his parents liked, but on his own he was inspired by the soul and rhythm and blues singers he heard on the radio or saw on stage, notably Jackie Wilson, whose hit ballad ""To Be Loved"" Thomas later covered and adopted as a kind of guide to his life. ""I was raised in a fairly dysfunctional situation and I went through years of intense alcoholism and drug addiction so the song was always a touchstone for me. When you open yourself up to drugs and alcohol at such a young age it becomes something you have to deal with the rest of your life,"" he told the Huffington Post in 2014. ""What a road block and heartbreak and times of failure these addictions have caused me. But I had that little piece of lightning from that song. That's the essence of the whole thing. To love and be loved. And that takes a lifetime to accomplish. It's always been an important part of my emotions.""Contributing: Bryan Alexander, USA TODAY; Ed Masley, Arizona Republic; and the Associated Press'The Very Hungry Caterpillar': Author Eric Carle dies at 91",author,date

Williams captioned one of the clips. ""The only time we’ll let y’all eavesdrop on our group chats!!""In one clip, Rowland chimed in on the idea of checking in, saying, ""You have to allow yourself to hold a safe place in a safe space for all friendships to be able to check in.""She continued, ""It's a blessing to be able to have that. When it's your person, it's nothing that they'll judge you for. It's nothing you can't tell them, and I think that that's the greatest thing Destiny's Child has ever given me, is my gift of friendship for you ladies.""Healthy friendships and social connection are important and can have a positive impact on your mental health and well-being, experts say.""Connecting with others can help lower stress and foster a sense of meaning and purpose,"" says David Harari, a psychiatrist and director of behavioral health at K Health. ""Research also shows that social connection is associated with increased happiness, improved health and longevity.""Checking in 'shows that you care'And just like the Destiny's Child phone call reunion demonstrated, part of building close friendships is taking time to check in.""Checking in with friends, through good times or bad, shows that you care and are there for support, something we could all benefit from in an increasingly changing world,"" Harari says. The Mayo Clinic suggests making an effort to see friends regularly and to check in with them in between meet-ups.Staying connected can be an important part of maintaining mental health no matter your age. Sierra Filucci, editorial director of child advocacy group Common Sense Media, told USA TODAY in March 2020 that young people also benefit from check-ins with friends.“Any opportunity to keep up social contact between kids is good just overall for mental health,” she said. “For younger kids, social interaction can be a very important part of education, and for older kids, social interaction is an important part of their social development.”Michelle Williams:Destiny's Child star 'proudly, happily' sought mental health treatmentIn one clip, Williams also opened up about wishing she came to her friends sooner about her mental health challenges.""It's OK to not be OK, and it's OK to tell somebody you're not OK,"" she shared. ""Because honestly, I should have done that with y'all.

What does that mean?","You've likely started to hear the term ""nonbinary"" more frequently. On Wednesday, Demi Lovato announced they were nonbinary and changed their pronouns to they/them.""Nonbinary"" refers to someone who does not identify only as a man or a woman, i.e. the traditional gender binary, according to the Human Rights Campaign. They could identify as both a man and a woman, in between the two genders or not a part of any gender category at all. GLAAD offers a similar definition.Someone who is transgender may also be nonbinary – Elliot Page, for example, identifies as both – but that is not always the case. GLAAD recommends only calling someone nonbinary if they claim that identity themselves.For more details:Demi Lovato comes out as nonbinary, changes pronouns to they/themIt has become increasingly common for some people who identify as nonbinary use a singular ""they/them"" pronoun. Nonbinary also exists as a catch-all term for various gender identities.""Nonbinary can also be used as an umbrella term encompassing identities such as agender, bigender, genderqueer or gender-fluid,"" according to the Human Rights Campaign.Gender identity and sexual orientation are two different things – meaning someone identifying as nonbinary has no bearing on to whom they are attracted.The proliferation of the term comes as a record number of U.S. adults – 5.6% – identify as LGBTQ, an increase propelled by a younger generation staking out its presence in the world, a poll released in February shows.The impact of coming out:Elliot Page came out as transgender. Here's what that means for young trans people.Other celebrities that identify as nonbinary include Sara Ramirez and Sam Smith.Ramirez, a former ""Grey's Anatomy"" star,  said they were nonbinary in 2020 in an Instagram post.Grammy-winning singer Sam Smith came out as nonbinary and genderqueer in 2019, sharing a few months later they use ""they/them"" pronouns after what the pop star called a ""lifetime of being at war with my gender.""Lovato's coming out video was similarly empowering. ""I feel this best represents the fluidity I feel in my gender expression and allows me to feel most authentic and true to the person I both know I am and am still discovering,"" they said.Contributing: Hannah Yasharoff and Susan Miller",author,date

Other accounts like @sporttothin have popped up sharing videos of the technique to their nearly 1 million followers.But the move likely isn't all it's cracked up to be, say fitness experts.Morit Summers, personal trainer and founder of Form Fitness Brooklyn, describes the move as a ""very aggressive hip thrust"" that could be dangerous, especially to the lower back.""I actually think that if you do that too much you could potentially cause some real spinal and nerve pain,"" she said. ""I would just want people to be careful and maybe change it up a little bit.""Erin Schirack, fitness instructor and co-founder of streaming fitness platform CHI-SOCIETY, says there is some validity in the sense of the move itself, which she describes as a ""pelvic tuck,"" which can ""help loosen up the lower back and find engagement in the lower abs.""The way it's done in this viral class, she says, is not proper form.""That format is so wild and out of control that it causes it to actually be completely ineffective,"" she said. ""(It's) not done in a safe manner.""Schirack also says the claims about targeting the stomach area need to be busted.""If anybody ever tells you that a move or an exercise is designed to target something, they're using it as a marketing tool,"" she said.While there are moves that can help strengthen a certain area, she says it's a ""complete myth"" that someone can minimize the size of a certain body part with just one move. Some people who have tried out the movement have posted about seeing results themselves, though. User @melofficial97 shared a video that compared her progress after a month, where she showed off a more toned tummy. In another video, she writes, ""this workout is legit.""Summers explains this is likely overall weight loss in the body due to increased movement, not stomach fat being specifically reduced as a direct result of this workout.""If you're someone that's been very sedentary, and you are motivated by this trend to get up and move, then yes, you're going to see a change in your body, because you're suddenly adding activity,"" she explained.Summers says the seeming simplicity of the move could have attracted people who haven't been working out much throughout the past year.""It looks rather easy, right? She's more or less standing in place and just kind of moving her hips. So I think if you haven't been doing much and you're like, 'Oh that looks like something I can do.' That's one piece of it,"" she explains.Schirack thinks the workout has also gained traction due to ""the ridiculousness of the move.""""People think the more ridiculous an exercise is and more complex or silly it looks, they think it must be that secret target to effectiveness,"" she said. Users obsession with the workout may also be amplified from a desire to get in shape for post-pandemic life.As vaccines have rolled out across the country, trainers say they've seen significant increases in clients aiming to look their best by the time the world fully reopens.Though fitness and mental health professionals agree a healthy lifestyle is a worthy goal, they caution against quick physical transformations – especially after a year that was traumatic for so many.""You can't just jump right back into working out six, seven days a week like you did in the beginning,"" Noam Tamir, founder and CEO of the New York City gym TS Fitness, told USA TODAY in March.

Be careful: If you blend too much, you can lose the effect of the gradient altogether and if you blend too little, the contrast can look too harsh. Finishing touches: You can clean up the edges of your lips with some concealer.And voilà! Pretty as a picture.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2021/05/25/sexist-dress-codes-and-altered-yearbook-photos-teach-girls-body-shame/7429562002/,Those infamous edited yearbook photos and society’s obsession with girls' bodies: 'You can't win',"A Florida high school has attracted national attention for altering 80 students' yearbook photos to add more clothing to their chests and shoulders, obscuring cleavage and sometimes even clavicle bones. All the students were female, none consented to having their images digitally altered, and many of them said they felt humiliated by the incident. The drama at Bartram Trail High School in St. Johns County, Florida, embodies an ever-present double bind for women and girls who are told in myriad ways that in order to be feminine, desirable and culturally valued they must be sexy – they see it in the most-liked images on social media, in clothing ads and in the portrayal of their gender in movies and on TV. Yet when young girls, especially, attempt to live up to that expectation, to reveal their bodies even modestly, they are frequently scrutinized and punished.""There's just so much ambivalence,"" said Abigail Saguy, a sociologist at UCLA who studies gender dynamics. ""On the one hand you're giving the message to pretty young girls that women need to be sexualized to have value in this world and then on the other hand we're punishing them for participating in this. You can't win.""Experts say the school's editing of strictly female bodies reflects society's disproportionate focus on girls' appearances, also evident in the school's dress code, which is more detailed and restrictive for the school's female students. But it also shows how the school views the girls' bodies as symbols of the institution itself, and reveals their calculation that modesty equates to morality. The problem, experts say, is that the school's manipulation of these photos doesn't show girls how to respect their bodies or how to be ""good."" It instructs them to be ashamed. ""This is the school teaching them, along with everything else that they're learning in school, a whole curriculum on body shame,"" Saguy said. More on dress codes: California school's no-shame dress code empowers students to wear what they wantA dress code of double standardsLast month, before the school's yearbook editing fiasco, it came under fire for its dress code, which disproportionally targets female students. The boys' dress code has three bullet points. Male students are instructed to ensure ""mustaches and beards shall be neatly trimmed,"" that ""revealing clothing"" is unacceptable, and that pants ""must be worn at the waist"" with no underwear visible.The girls' section also has three bullets, but is packed with more detailed directives. Girls are told the appropriate length of their skirts, are forbidden to show any parts of their stomachs, can't use hair curlers, can't wear ""excessive makeup"" and must adhere to the mandate that ""tops and shirts must cover the entire shoulder and they must be modest and not revealing or distracting,"" among other rules.As its designed, Bartram's dress code heavily polices the bodies of female students. And in including the word ""distracting"" in the girls list and not the boys, perpetuates the notion that women's bodies tempt men and must therefore be inconspicuous. It fuels the dangerous myth that boys cannot control their sexual desires, which is often used to absolve boys and men when they commit sexual violence. School dress codes that target female students have received increased attention in recent years, with experts arguing that their hyper-focus on girls is unfair and discriminatory. Kate Mason, a gender studies professor at Wheaton College, said school dress codes on their own can be useful, but they become harmful when they target one group over another. ""I'm not saying that schools don't have a role in teaching kids what is appropriate. I remember when I was in high school they said we couldn't have T-shirts with profanity on it. That was probably a good lesson to learn,"" she said. ""It's not that schools don't have a right to have a dress code, but you see these pretty pronounced disparities in the extent to which boys versus girls bodies are policed."" Mason also notes that dress codes can be especially punitive to girls of color, whose bodies are more heavily scrutinized than white girls. A 2017 study from Georgetown Law’s Center on Poverty and Inequality found adults view Black girls as less innocent than their white peers, especially between the ages of 5 and 14. Adults also believe Black girls know more about sex.Scrutiny dangerous and painful during adolescenceScrutiny typically begins in adolescence, when girls' bodies begin to change and mature. We see it in the tropes on TV – a father rushing to cover up a teenage daughter in a bathing suit – or in the moralizing around what clothes are appropriate for young women to wear.""I think it sends the message that our girls should be ashamed of their growing bodies, and I think that's a horrible message to send out to these young girls that are going through these changes,"" said Adrian Bartlett, the mother of one of the female students at Bartram Trail whose photo was altered.Kjerstin Gruys, a sociologist at the University of Nevada, Reno whose research focuses on the relationship between physical appearance and social inequality, said the editing increases the hyper-visibility of girls' bodies, which is uncomfortable and often painful for young girls to navigate. The school's edits – which were clumsy and noticeable – only attracted further unwanted attention.""It just really singles out women for their appearance and their supposed sexuality. But there's no reason we have to sexualize breasts this much,"" she said. ""The scrutiny on girls' bodies is really toxic."" 'Is my bra strap showing? Is my cleavage showing? It is exhausting'Research shows adolescence is a pivotal time for the development of self-esteem. Hyper-focus on a young person's appearance can impact their body image across a lifespan.Saguy said the message the school is sending has dangerous consequences for female students during a time in their lives when they are already incredibly vulnerable. Adolescence is a sensitive period during which children experiment with their appearance, with how they want to look and feel as they move through the world.Saguy and Mason both note it can be difficult for girls to even find clothing that isn't sexualized. The options for girls, if they're moderately stylish, are often revealing. Midriff-baring shirts are everywhere on Tik Tok and Instagram. ""It's just this added tax on women's psyches, that in addition to everything else that they have to be worrying about, they also have to wonder, 'What do I look like? How am I being perceived? Is my bra strap showing? Is my cleavage showing? How am I appearing to other people?' It is exhausting,"" Saguy said.Being an adolescent girl is confusing and overwhelming, especially when getting mixed messages about how to be a girl that adults admire, that boys desire and that feels true to themselves. Experts say it's tough to know what role schools should play in that, but what Mason finds encouraging is that it appears more students and their parents are seeing the impossibility of girls' positions. ""I think this is an area where we've seen a lot of young teen feminists becoming really vocal,"" she said. ""Young girls now have a much better sense of how messed up this is and that they can clap back. I think another important part of the story is girls, with the support of their families, are pushing back on this and saying, 'No, my body isn't the problem here.'""You may also be interested in:Goodbye heels, hello 'lady-stache': Many women ditch beauty routines for goodJill Biden’s tights and why society is obsessed with what older women wearBody positivity is everywhere, but is it for everyone?The picture Khloe Kardashian didn't want you to see and the pressure to look perfect",author,date

""We watched it take place all summer long when people were peacefully demonstrating.""Coping with the riots:What to do about that pit in your stomach in this terrifying American moment'Double standard':Black lawmakers and activists decry police response to attack on US CapitolThese conversations spilled over to social media and they might be happening within your own home or inner circle.But how does someone, especially someone who's white, start (or continue) a conversation with family and friends about racism and privilege?In order to help get you started, USA TODAY spoke with experts to create this guide on best practices and important things to remember when engaging in this type of work.Of course, there is not a one-tactic-fits-all approach to having these difficult conversations.As Jenna Arnold, author of ""Raising Our Hands: How White Women Can Stop Avoiding Hard Conversations, Start Accepting Responsibility, and Find Our Place on the New Frontlines,"" told USA TODAY it's important to remember that these conversations are ""a little bit case-by-case.""So instead of a step-by-step guide, we've compiled tips and strategies for different steps of the process, from before the conversation starts to after it ends.Things to remember before getting startedKnow your purpose:Dr. Amanda Taylor, senior adjunct professorial lecturer, School of International Service at American University, pointed to Ijeoma Oluo's book ""So You Want to Talk About Race,"" in which she suggests to first find your purpose or ""why.""""It is really important to first personally get clear about why you want to have this conversation, and what you are hoping to communicate or understand,"" Taylor said. Realize it will likely get uncomfortable:""We must remember that real learning – about anything – only actually happens when we are uncomfortable,"" Taylor explained. ""For white people who have been engaged in the ongoing process of antiracist learning, I think it is very important that we actively commit to doing the work to support the learning and growth of our white friends, colleagues, and family members, even – and especially – when it is hard.""Dr. Lorenzo Boyd, associate professor of criminal justice and assistant provost of diversity and inclusion at the University of New Haven, also spoke to why the conversations can get uncomfortable (and some people can quickly get defensive).""The level of discomfort is going to happen,"" Boyd said. ""Some people are so used to privilege that equality feels like oppression.""Arnold echoed, ""Engaging in this work requires getting comfortable with discomfort.""Do your research:Before jumping into discussions about racism and privilege, it's important to educate yourself on these topics.""It is really important you do your background research, so you more fully understand the ideas you are attempting to get across or the point you are trying to make in the conversation,"" Taylor said.Help your mental health:What to do about that pit in your stomach in this terrifying American momentStarting a conversation about racism, privilegeState your intentions:""State (your) intention clearly at the beginning of the conversation, so the person engaging with you is clear about the goals as well. That can help ensure that the conversation is as productive as possible,"" Taylor said.Remember that discomfort we talked about? Use that as a jumping off point.Arnold says she often puts her vulnerability in front of the conversation.""I will say, 'I want to talk to you about something that I'm wrestling with, but I'm not quite sure why and it might make us uncomfortable, are you OK if we have that conversation?' So instead of trying to compartmentalize the discomfort, spread it out. Let everybody know it's coming,"" she said.Arnold says this is helpful for two reasons: The conversation is never as bad as people think it's going to be if you preface it that way and it invites the other person to do the same.Best practices during the conversationKnow your audience:Jermaine Graves, a licensed clinical professional counselor based in Washington, D.C., says it's helpful to use an angle that the other person has an interest in because it may help them to listen or understand.""For example, if they're into sports, maybe try to give an example that's related to sports – maybe use sports as a metaphor to try to redirect the conversation,"" she said. ""(When) working with children or the younger generations, you may have to bring in toys or little props and things like that just to kind of help relay that information.""Taylor also suggests using resources that best “speak the language” of those learning.Ask questions:""Always engaging with questions versus telling,"" Arnold said. ""Because it always puts people back on their heels.""Listen actively:Paraphrasing your understanding of what the other person has said is helpful, Graves explained, because if there's further clarity that's needed, the person that's giving the information can ""try to come from the different angle or get their point across in a different way if needed.""Use narratives:Arnold explains that facts are ""worthy to look at,"" but using human-focused stories and examples can be more powerful.""We have to invite and get humanity in a way that a statistic never would,"" Arnold said. ""As we've seen in our political system, facts don't ever win arguments in ways that you think they would... Statistics often become battlegrounds and it's not often helpful when you're trying to bring people back to their humanity.""Taylor added that reading books or watching movies focused on human narratives that ""illuminate the impact of racism on real people"" can be a powerful tool when using this approach.She cautioned that this can not be where the conversation or learning ends though.""Only focusing on individual narratives misses the ways that racism is fundamentally about institutions, policies, systems and structures,"" she explained.Other tips:Graves said going into these discussions empathizing with others and being compassionate is helpful. She also advises ""trying to come in with a calm demeanor and an open mind.""Things to avoidBeing performative:""You don't want to let yourself fall for the trap of performing some level of wokeness for an audience,"" Arnold warned. More on performative allyship:George Floyd, Lea Michele and the problem with performative outrageShaming others:""The first human response of preventing shame is defensiveness,"" Arnold said. ""So if you're setting them up to take them down in front of five people, 25 people, there's no way they hear you. They're just in an ego-based survival mode.""Arnold clarifies that this approach doesn't pardon anyone who's been out of line, citing Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper, a recent example of a white person unnecessarily calling the police on a Black person. ""There are some circumstances that require immediate action,"" she says.Boyd added that shaming someone's privilege isn't the goal in these conversations.""You having privilege in and of itself is not problematic, how you deal with people who don't is the issue that we're trying to deal with,"" he explained.Cashing checks, napping and more:Black people doing normal things who had police called on themInterrupting:Graves said that both sides of the conversation should ""fully allow the person that's speaking to get their points across without interruption.""Stereotyping:""I know sometimes we're brought up with a lot of different biases and sometimes it's really embedded or unconscious we may not necessarily know that we have a bias, but just trying to be aware of that when we are having those conversations,"" Graves said.Making it directly about them:Boyd suggests phrasing like: ""I'm not talking about you, I'm talking in general terms.""""If I can deflect it from you, you're less likely to get defensive,"" he explained. ""I often use the term, 'There's a guy that I know.'

""Shutting down, whether by disengaging, crying, or keeping the conversation centered on our personal feelings, re-centers our own emotions rather than the emotions of those most harmed by racism and its ongoing impacts.""Tips for defensivenessFind common ground:Finding where your views align can help determine where exactly your views diverge and lead to more productive conversations.""Always try to put yourself in the other person's shoes just to try and understand where they're coming from,"" Grave said.Flip the script:Boyd suggests ""trying to get people to understand a different perspective.""""(Saying), your story is important, but can we flip things around?"" he explained. ""Self-reflection is really important to understanding and if you can do self-reflection, you can begin to go toward empathy.""For example, try re-imagining the country ""flipped on it's axis,"" Boyd explained, where the majority of people are Black (including all elected officials, police departments, etc.), and ask, ""How hard would it be for a white person to try and get ahead?""Be prepared for common rebuttals:""I don't see color""""When you say, 'You don't see color,' that's amazingly offensive to people of color,"" Boyd said.

The original Instagram post had thousands of comments before being taken down.The Star of David has six points and is formed of two, often interlaced, equilateral triangles. Approximately 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust, when Nazis forced Jews to identify themselves by wearing a yellow six-pointed star.The business responded with an Instagram statement defending the move: ""People are so outraged by my post? But are you outraged with the tyranny the world is experiencing? If you don't understand what is happening, that is on you not me.

That is not who I am & what I stand for.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2021/05/30/retirement-age-risks-running-out-money-after-retire/5273483001/,5 big money risks in retirement you should know and prepare for now,"Planning for retirement can be tricky. It requires sacrifice in terms of saving money over many years, shrewdness in investing it and discipline in withdrawing it cautiously.In addition, you must deal with uncertainties such as how long you might live, future inflation rates and how much you could incur in medical expenses.No wonder many people fail to minimize the following five key risks of retirement. From withdrawing too much early in retirement to underestimating health costs and failing to plan for taxes, there are a lot of potential pitfalls. And don't forget about inflation and planning a buffer in case you live to be 115. ►Stock alert:Consider buying these 3 stocks in retirement►Social Security isn't fixed income:Here are 5 ways to boost your retirement benefitHere are the biggest risks to be aware of:1. Withdrawing big early in retirementThere's a natural tendency to want to spend liberally early in retirement, when your health is better and your interests and hobbies more varied. But taking a large withdrawal from stock-focused investment accounts can be hazardous if the market plunges soon thereafter.""You have less time to make a comeback, especially when you are starting to withdraw from those accounts,"" said Jim Braun, president of Tri-State Retirement in a commentary.Visualize the damage wrought in a tough year like 2008, when large stocks tumbled 37% on average. To recover from a plunge of that size, your portfolio would need to rebound by 60%. If you also had withdrawn, say, another 10% to splurge on vacations or a new car, it would have been harder to make up the lost ground.One way to lessen this risk would be to start with a relatively low withdrawal rate and increase it gradually over time. Another option would be to shift into more conservative assets, though few retirees have all of their assets in the stock market anyway.A 4% annual withdrawal rate is a common suggestion to maintain a portfolio's size without depleting it too quickly.""It is grounded in academic research, but it is not foolproof,"" noted Jack Brennan, the former CEO of Vanguard, in his new book written with John Woerth, ""More Straight Talk on Investing."" He suggests starting with a 3% or 3.5% withdrawal rate to minimize the risk of depleting your account too quickly.2. Not recognizing the inflation riskGeneral price levels have risen only modestly over the past four decades, but that could change. While many powerful disinflationary forces are still at play, from technological innovation to the graying demographic trend, inflation has spiked recently. Just think how much home prices, rents, gasoline prices and restaurant meals have risen lately.Medical inflation is another worry for retirees. According to Fidelity Investments, a 65-year-old, opposite-gender couple retiring this year can expect to spend $300,000 combined in health and medical expenses throughout retirement. That's up from a $230,000 estimate 10 years ago. Fidelity's estimate assumes individuals don't have employer-provided medical coverage in retirement but do qualify for Medicare.Suppose you plan to take 4%, or $40,000, from a $1 million portfolio each year. ""That $40,000 won’t have the same spending power in year 10 of retirement as it did in year one,"" said Braun. As noted earlier, one way to offset this risk is by starting with a lower withdrawal rate and gradually increasing it. Also, try to hold some cash elsewhere so you can slow or halt withdrawals during down-market years.Bonds and other fixed-income investments form the core of many retiree portfolios, as they tend to exhibit price stability. But many of these assets could be treacherous now. If inflationary expectations become more pronounced, bond prices will drop. Granted, bonds rarely decline as much as stocks, but stocks have more capacity to recoup losses. Hence the wisdom of holding both stocks and bonds in a mixed portfolio.3. Underestimating health costsMedical expenses are an important inflationary component that retirees must heed. In addition to inflation itself, many people don't prepare for unexpected medical outlays.For example, ""At some point, you could require long-term care, which comes with a staggering price tag,"" Braun said. Seven in 10 people will require such assistance at some point in their lives, though it won't necessarily extend for years at a time. At any rate, few people prepare for this contingency, he said.Medical expenses are a wild card. ""Covering health-care costs is one of the most significant, yet unpredictable, aspects of retirement planning,"" said Hope Manion, a senior vice president in Fidelity's workplace consulting unit.Health savings accounts are a great way to prepare. These accounts combine tax-free contributions, tax-sheltered investment growth and tax-free withdrawals if used to meet a broad list of medical expenses. Yet HSAs are also widely underutilized, Fidelity reported, with many people not contributing the maximum yearly dollar amount or investing their funds too cautiously.►5 novel ways to use HSAs:Invest, reimburse yourself for old expenses, more4. Outliving your assetsRising life expectancy increases the chances that you could deplete your savings sooner than expected.""If you are calculating that you just need enough money for a 10- or 20-year retirement, you could be in for a surprise,"" said Braun, noting that one in five men who reach age 65 will live to 90. Among women, it's one in three. This is another reason to retain some stock-market or other growth investments in a balanced portfolio.Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor, calls longevity risk a key danger and one that many individuals don't appreciate. ""People think living a long time is good news,"" said Kotlikoff, co-author of ""Get What’s Yours – the Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security Benefits.""He added: ""But it can be terrible news from a financial perspective.""This explains his strong recommendation that people delay claiming Social Security for as long as possible – preferably to age 70, when benefits hit their monthly maximum. Think of those increased payments as a type of insurance against the risk that you wind up living a lot longer than expected, he said.5. Failing to plan for taxesYou have accumulated money for years if not decades in tax-sheltered 401(k) plans, Individual Retirement Accounts and the like. Why not keep it going for as long as possible? Often, that is the best strategy, especially if you need to build up your retirement cache further. But there might be reasons to withdraw gradually from these accounts before you're required to do so.For example, you wouldn't want to make large required minimum withdrawals from retirement accounts once you have started to claim Social Security. Too much income of various types can push you into a higher tax bracket and make some of your Social Security benefits taxable, too.There isn't a single best strategy here as individual circumstances vary. But you should have a plan for coordinating retirement withdrawals, possible job income and Social Security benefits with an eye on minimizing the tax bite. Reach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com.",author,date

https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/05/30/mortgage-benefits-national-guard-veterans/44523699/,New mortgage benefits for the National Guard could help thousands buy homes,"In December 2020, Congress passed the Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act. Part of that bill expanded the number of National Guard troops who have access to VA loan benefits. The National Guard Association of the United States estimates that more than 50,000 Guardsmen will gain VA loan eligibility.What changedPreviously, Guardsmen and reservists became eligible for VA home loan benefits after six years of service, reports Chris Birk, VP of Mortgage Insight and Director of Education at Veterans United.While six years of service was the default requirement, exceptions were sometimes granted. For example, Guardsmen called up under Title 10 (directed by the president to report for active duty) became eligible for a VA loan after 90 days of consecutive service. However, Guardsmen called up under Title 32 (by the governors of their states) were not granted early eligibility.Buying a home?:Tips to improve your credit score‘I don’t care that I’m overpaying’:Houses are selling over asking price. Here’s how to win a real estate bidding war.Birk explains that Guardsmen who served during large-scale state disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Katrina were not granted early eligibility. This bill was designed, in part, to bring Title 10 and Title 32 benefits closer together.""Because of this bill, Guardsmen mobilized under Title 32 gain VA loan eligibility after serving 90 days of full-time duty, provided at least 30 of those days were consecutive,"" Birk said.An added perk of the new legislation is that the change is retroactive. Guard members who served long ago but fell short of the six-year requirement could now be eligible for a VA loan.Why it mattersThe signing of this bipartisan bill acknowledges the role played by members of the National Guard, both full-time and reservists. These are the men and women who go into disaster zones while others are heading out, and put their lives on the line to protect fellow citizens. Making them eligible for a VA loan may be a small token of gratitude. Still, if the National Guard Association is correct, it represents a way for thousands of Guardsmen to own a slice of the American Dream.Benefits of a VA loanVA loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). While private lenders issue the mortgages, the VA backs them, promising to pay the lender back if the borrower fails to make payments. There's a lot to like about VA loans, including these features:No down payment. Veterans don't have to wait for years to save up for a down payment -- they can enter the housing market whenever the time feels right.Historically low interest rates. Data from Ellie Mae shows that VA loans have offered the lowest fixed interest rate on the market for five years running.No mortgage insurance payment. If a home buyer takes out a conventional mortgage or another type of government-backed loan, they need to make a 20% down payment or pay private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI is an insurance policy that protects the lender if the borrower defaults on the loan. The fact that the VA backs the loan means buyers don't have to pay a monthly PMI payment. The savings can be thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.More forgiving lending standards. According to Birk, the VA has more ""flexible and forgiving credit guidelines than other loan types."" In addition, Guard members and reservists may use their service income to help qualify for a mortgage. Lenders look at how long they have served and the relative stability of the income, but if everything looks good, that extra monthly income might help them get into the home they want.Some form of the U.S. National Guard has been around since 1636. Although it's easy to wonder what took Congress so long, it's good to know that Guardsmen and reservists are being recognized with these benefits now.Walmart, Costco, Trader Joe's, Publix no longer require masks for vaccinated customers, Starbucks starts Monday  Old iPhones, PCs and printers: How to recycle or dump e-waste  Taxes Q&A: How do I file a tax extension for 2021?

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives.Spring! The birds are chirping, flowers are blooming—and your pets have been stuck inside all winter, shedding the whole time. You've got to clean up all that pet hair—but sometimes a lint roller or vacuum cleaner just won't get the job done.Fear not, we have some hot tips on how to get fur off of your couches, carpets, and car—all without the use of harsh or expensive chemicals.1. Give your couch the rubber glove treatmentWhether your pets couch surf while you're not at home, or just shed on long car trips, there's a better solution than covering up your upholstery with ugly covers. Just bust out the same rubber gloves you wear when you wash the dishes.Thanks to the unique texture of a rubber glove, all you need to do is run your gloved hands all over your couch or car seats. When you're done, you can brush the hair off the gloves and right into the trash.Buy Playtex Hand Saver dishwashing gloves for $11.35 at Amazon.com2. Pumice rocks the fur awayIf there's a spot where your cat or dog loves to settle down, it's probably caked in hair. When that hair is matted so hard it's impossible to remove with a vacuum, try scraping a pumice stone over the area. The scratchy texture of pumice helps lift hair out of the carpet's loops. In addition to carpets, this solution works wonders in your car, too.You could buy a stone that's specially made for removing pet hair, or just buy a generic four pack for the same price.Buy the Fur-Zoff pumice pet hair remover for $12.05 at Amazon.com3. Let your dryer do the work for youThrowing your clothes into the dryer with a bunch of dryer sheets is one way to get unwanted pet hair off your shirts, blouses, pants, and even your socks. However, dryer sheets actually have some pretty harsh chemicals in them.That's why we like the Dryer Maid Ball. When the balls tumble in the dryer, they create static electricity that attracts pet hair off your clothes. There are a lot of dryer balls on the market, but user reviews for the Dryer Maid brand are largely positive.Buy Dryer-Maid Balls for $16.99 at Amazon.com4. The Furminator is out thereYou could also address the problem at the source. Good grooming can keep your pet from shedding, which is why so many cat and dog owners are fans of the Furminator.This brush is designed to pass through an animal's top coat while gently removing loose hair from its undercoat. Its creators claim that it can reduce shedding by up to 90 percent—which will cut down on the amount of hair that ends up on your upholstery and carpets.

Upgrade your vacuumIf you own a pet, you should also own a good vacuum. At Reviewed.com, we've tested hundreds of vacuums over the past five years, and we think the Kenmore 81614 is the best choice for cleaning pet hair.Because it's a canister vacuum—with a long hose that accepts specialty attachments—it's easier to clean curtains and upholstery. One of those attachments, the Pet PowerMate, is a tiny powered brush that can agitate fur and hair out of fabrics and carpet—even in places other vacuums wouldn't fit.Buy a Kenmore 81614 vacuum on Amazon for $276.67",author,date

Kroger is offering prizes to vaccinated customers,"Helping with the national drive to get 70% of Americans vaccinated against COVID-19, Kroger is offering customers, workers or individuals who get the shot the chance to win $1 million or free groceries for a year.The sweepstakes are being offered in collaboration with the Biden Administration as part of the president’s bid to get the U.S. toward the threshold of herd immunity – where so many Americans are protected against the new coronavirus that it can’t spread.Starting next week, Kroger will offer a $1 million prize and, separately, free groceries for a year to 10 other winners. The grocer will offer five weekly drawings, ultimately awarding five $1 million prizes and a free year's groceries to 50 other winners.Details and rules will be announced next week for the campaign, called “The Community Immunity Giveaway” and promoting it on social media with #CommunityImmunity. People who have already gotten vaccinated are also eligible to enter the drawings.Vaccine giveaway:CVS to offer sweepstakes for COVID vaccine recipientsKroger has provided COVID-19 vaccinations since December and so far distributed more than 4.6 million doses. It began vaccinations in Ohio in January.Early this year, Kroger offered employees a $100 bonus to get vaccinated.Last week, as vaccinations became more widespread, Kroger dropped its mandatory mask policy for workers and shoppers who have gotten their shots.Kroger officials say the program was hatched after the Biden Administration reached out to ask how to get more Americans vaccinated. Biden has said he wants at least 70% of Americans to get at least one vaccine shot by July 4.“Businesses like Kroger are stepping up to the plate to encourage vaccinations,"" said Ian Sams, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in a statement. ""To vaccinate more Americans and help bring this pandemic to an end, we all have to do our part, and it’s exciting that Kroger is using innovative tactics.""Kroger officials said the company is paying for the program itself as a ""good corporate citizen"" and not receiving any tax or other incentives from the government to hold the giveaway.“The faster we reach community immunity, the sooner we can all get back to enjoying backyard barbecues, live music and gathering for special occasions,” said Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen, in a statement. ""(This) is another way we are doing our part to help America recover from the public health crisis and safely return to normal.”Besides Kroger stores, the Cincinnati-based grocer operates several regional supermarket chains in 35 states, including Fred Meyer, Harris Teeter, Ralphs, Mariano's, Fry's, Smith's, King Soopers, QFC and others.

It includes price hikes for first-class mail, magazines and marketing mailers. The price hikes are part of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s 10-year plan for the agency, which faces an estimated $160 billion in operating losses over the next decade.DeJoy said the increases are necessary to “achieve financial sustainability and service excellence” and will allow the postal service to “remain viable and competitive and offer reliable postal services that are among the most affordable in the world.”The Washington Post reported that the price hikes also are being accompanied by hundreds of layoffs of “management-level employees.” An email to postal officials seeking confirmation of the layoffs did not receive an immediate response.Watch:House panel grills Dejoy ahead of USPS reform planMay 28:Spain's new 'equality stamps' celebrate different skin tones. But the lightest shades cost the most.The Post Office has grappled with declining revenues for years; in the past decade, overall mail volume has dropped 28 percent, and first-class letters have declined by 47 percent, according to the agency. It also faces fierce competition in the package delivery business from FedEx, UPS and Amazon.DeJoy, a major donor to former president Donald Trump, became a figure of national controversy last year when he was publicly accused by Democrats of hampering mail service for political reasons. His attempted service cuts were seen as an extension of Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting.After Trump’s defeat, DeJoy’s position was considered to be in jeopardy. The Senate has approved three new appointees to the Postal Service’s governing board, giving the nine-member board a Democratic majority.However, DeJoy’s dismissal is not certain. Postal Service board Chairman Ron Bloom, a Democrat, told House lawmakers in February that DeJoy “in very difficult circumstances is doing a good job.”",author,date

All the while, the allure of a rapid escape is tantalizingly near -- just liquidate your positions by pressing a few buttons.But the promise of salvation through panicked selling is a false one that will harm your financial future if you allow it to control you. So, let's take a look at five reasons why you should keep your stocks just the way they are during a crash.1. Selling realizes your losses permanentlyPerhaps the most immediate reason not to sell your holdings during a market crash is that selling chisels your losses indelibly into your portfolio. If you invested $1,000 into a stock then sold it for $750 after a collapse in the market the next day, you're tangibly deprived of that $250 forever. In such a case, your other investments would need to grow to make up the difference in your portfolio, or you'd need to invest that much more to get back to where you were before. ADP, PepsiCo, Sysco:Consider buying these 3 stocks in retirementInflation, employment, profits and investments:A year after recovery began, here's how the economy is gradedIn the very long run of the American stock market so far, crashes haven't ever led to a permanently lower price level. After the sharp correction of late 2018 and the coronavirus crash of 2020, the market rebounded to surpass its previous highs before a full year had passed. Selling during the fall would have made investors miss out on future gains in both cases.There's no guarantee that your stocks will grow again to reach their prior level, but if your portfolio is sufficiently diversified, you can bet that the show will go on after a major dip. So, it's best to stay the course by not selling and give your stocks a chance to recover.2. There's nothing different about your companiesAs an intelligent and empowered investor, you should be making the decision to buy or sell based on the financial strength and competitive capabilities of the businesses that underlie stocks. That means keeping your attention focused on fundamentals like revenue, profitability, management, and competitive advantages relative to other companies in the same industry. For the most part, the movement of the market has nothing to do with any of those factors, regardless of whether there's a juicy feast for bears or a wild bull run. Unless one of your companies is desperately in need of a high stock price to support a future round of share issuance and fundraising -- in which case it might not be a good investment to begin with -- a crash changes nothing. So, it doesn't make much sense to sell, because the company can still compete successfully after a correction (assuming it ever did). Medical bills, food, investing and mortgages:How Americans are spending their tax refunds, stimulusIf that doesn't seem right to you, take a look at AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) price behavior during and after the 2020 collapse. It fell, but recovered to its prior high in less than a quarter's time because it was still just as good of a business afterward as it was before. 3. You'll miss out on dividendsDividends are a key component of a stock's total shareholder return. If you dump your shares, you don't get the regular dividend payments that you were previously entitled to. In the case of a strong dividend stock like AbbVie, you could be missing out on a yield of around 4.5% per year, which grows quite quickly over time. That's a problem because it means that your portfolio will compound more slowly.Of course, you'll also miss out on special dividend payments, which can sometimes be quite substantial. Companies like Costco (NASDAQ: COST) are known for surprising shareholders with extra cash, and there's simply no chance for such a pleasant event if you don't own the stock anymore.4. You could get taxed on the salePaying taxes is part of being a responsible citizen, and shrewd investors understand that paying some taxes on their capital gains is necessary for society to function. But you should try to avoid incurring unnecessary tax burdens by panic selling.If a stock was worth more than you bought it for when you sold it, you'll probably owe taxes on the sale. The fact that the market crashed isn't relevant. The amount that the holding dropped isn't relevant either, as long as it's higher than your entry point.Is Dogecoin better than Bitcoin?:Careful not to invest everything into the lottery.If you held the stock for less than a year before the surreptitious selling, you could owe a short-term capital gains tax rate of up to 37% on the transaction. That could seriously chip away at your portfolio's value.5. It's a bad habit Emotions are a happy inevitability both in human life and in investing. But you shouldn't get into the habit of letting your anxiety or euphoria run the show. Your emotions are often intense and reactive to dynamic short-term events like a market crash. They can lead you astray by suggesting that selling your holdings is a solution to the anxiety that's caused by falling prices. Did I say lead you astray? Actually, the emotional proposition can be entirely correct: Selling your stocks will indeed make your anxiety go away somewhat. But it'll also make your portfolio's prospects of recovery very much diminished. Nip the bad habit in the bud by exercising your long-term thinking when the market is falling and anxiety is knocking.Walmart, Costco, Trader Joe's, Publix no longer require masks for vaccinated customers, Starbucks starts Monday  Old iPhones, PCs and printers: How to recycle or dump e-waste  Taxes Q&A: How do I file a tax extension for 2021?

The benchmark index is on track for a gain this week of about 1.1%. It hit an all-time high on May 7th but then fell for two straight weeks.Industrial and financial stocks were among the biggest gainers. General Electric jumped 7.1% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500, while Boeing rose 3.9% and JPMorgan Chase added 1.6%. Those gains were tempered largely by slide in technology companies. Health care and household goods makers also lagged the broader market. Treasury yields and energy prices rose.Investors were encouraged to see that weekly unemployment claims fell to another pandemic low and that the U.S. economy grew at a solid rate during the first quarter.'It's really frustrating':Worker shortages are putting more money in employees pockets but could slow the economy“We’re advising investors that if we’re going to get outsized positive economic news, it really supports the extent to which and the speed with which we’re going to see a reopening in the economy,” said Greg Bassuk, founder and CEO of AXS Investments. “And we think stocks are reacting positively to that today.”The S&P 500 rose 4.89 points to 4,200.88. It had been up 0.4% in the early going. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 141.59 points, or 0.4% to 34,464.64. The slide in technology stocks left the Nasdaq essentially flat. The index slipped 1.72 points, or less than 0.1%, to 13,736.28.In another signal that investors were confident about the economy going forward, the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks fared better than the broader market, picking up 23.80 points, or 1.1%, to 2,273.07.Online medical scrubs seller Figs surged 36.5% in its stock market debut, valuing the 8-year old company at $4.8 billion.Markets have been bumpy over the last few weeks as investors move past a stellar corporate earnings season and await additional clues on economic growth and inflation, which has been rising.Investors got a mostly positive set of economic reports Thursday. The number of Americans who filed for unemployment benefits fell yet again to a pandemic low of 406,000. A growing number of states, all of them controlled by Republicans, have started cutting off unemployed workers from the $300-a-week jobless benefit that was part of the latest economic recovery package. That’s likely pushing additional Americans into the active labor force.Meanwhile, there was disappointing data on sales of durable goods, that is expensive items that are expected to last three years or more, fell 1.3% according to the Commerce Department. That figure was expected to rise, according to economists.Lastly the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 6.4% annual rate in the first quarter as the economy recovers from the pandemic.Investors are looking ahead to Friday’s inflation data. The growing economy has raised inflation concerns, though analysts expect that much of the increase will be tied to economic growth and will be digestible.The data out Friday is the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures index, more commonly referred to as PCE. The Federal Reserve, whose job is to monitor and control inflation as best as they can, tends to rely on PCE data more than the more widely known consumer price index, or CPI, when making policy decisions.Bond yields have been relatively stable this week, and remained so on Thursday.

Retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending made solid gains. Communication and financial stocks also helped lift the market. The S&P 500′s gains were tempered by declines in health care, technology and other stocks.Smaller company stocks continued to outgain the rest of the market as they’ve done all year. Treasury yields mostly edged higher.'It's really frustrating':Worker shortages are putting more money in employees pockets but could slow the economyMarkets have been bumpy over the last few days as investors move past a stellar corporate earnings season and await additional clues on economic growth and inflation, which has been rising.“That’s just going to be the state of the market environment for some time to come,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.The S&P 500 rose 7.86 points to 4,195.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which turned 125 years old Wednesday, gained 10.59 points, or less than 0.1%, to 34,323.05. The blue-chip index swung between a gain of 97 points and a 41-point slide. The Nasdaq added 80.82 points, or 0.6%, to 13,738. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 43.52 points, or 2%, to 2,249.27.The S&P 500 hit an all-time high on May 7th, but then fell for two straight weeks heading into this week. The index is on track for a gain this week of about 1%.Investors bid up shares in several retailers that delivered strong quarterly report cards. Dick’s Sporting Goods jumped 16.9% after reporting a surge in first-quarter sales and solid earnings as team sports returned. Urban Outfitters rose 10% and Abercrombie & Fitch climbed 7.8% on similarly strong financial results.Retailers, hotels and cruise lines are poised for growth as more people get back to some semblance of normal with vaccinations increasing and the pandemic seemingly receding.The next key economic update is set for Thursday, when the Commerce Department releases its latest GDP report for the first quarter. Economists are expecting a huge rebound in 2021 and results from the beginning of the year will give Wall Street a clearer picture moving forward.The growing economy has also raised inflation concerns, though analysts expect that much of the increase will be tied to economic growth and will be digestible. Concern centers around stronger inflation prompting governments and central banks to roll back economic stimulus and change course on interest rates. Federal Reserve officials have said that they see no need yet to change course.Bond yields, which rose sharply earlier in the year, remained relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.58% from 1.56% from late Tuesday.“Investors need to stop worrying about short-term concerns around The Fed and inflation,” Hooper said. “That’s really creating a lot of the churn we’re seeing.”Online retail giant Amazon is buying MGM, the movie and TV studio behind James Bond, “Legally Blonde” and “Shark Tank,” with the aim of filling its video streaming service with more shows to watch.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2021/05/28/inflation-rising-prices-hurt-your-investments-not/7436647002/,Are rising prices and inflation going to hurt your investments? Here’s how to protect your nest egg.,"Americans are paying more for everything from rental cars to hotels this spring due to pent-up demand for travel, which has been juiced by extra cash from stimulus checks. But rising inflation won’t just weigh on your travel budget or your shopping bills. It could also affect your investments. So what about your 401(k) and mutual funds? What should you be thinking about if prices keep rising?While inflation eats away at the purchasing power of the dollar and decreases Americans' ability to pay for goods, there are ways for investors to protect themselves, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.'I really had sticker shock':Will a reopening economy mean surging prices for AmericansNo more driving distractions:High-tech windshields could change the way we drive“If you are worried about inflation, (then) commodities, real estate, value stocks, TIPS [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities] and bank loans all could be nice places to get some protection from the dreaded i-word,” Detrick said in a note.Just a blip? Or higher prices ahead?The Federal Reserve is keeping a close eye on rising prices after a surge in inflation last month ignited a debate over whether price increases will fade, or pick up steam and possibly lead to an overheating economy.On Friday, Wall Street turned its attention to a key measure for inflation, April's Personal Consumption Expenditures index, or PCE, which rose 3.1% from a year earlier (excluding volatile components like food and energy). When making policy decisions, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation is the PCE data instead of the more widely known consumer price index, or CPI. A longer bout of rising inflation could force the central bank to hike interest rates sooner than expected, which would push up borrowing costs for consumer loans like mortgages. That’s spooked some Americans who wonder if this is just a blip or a return to the hyperinflation economy of the 1970s. Most economists, however, don’t anticipate spiraling inflation.Why? Because many of the forces that have kept a lid on inflation for more than a decade remain in place, including tech innovation, globalization and increased productivity.“Moderate inflation isn’t a big deal,” says Adam Lampe, CEO and co-founder at Mint Wealth Management, an investment advisory firm. “Keep in mind that if inflation does exceed expectations, the Fed has opportunities to control and manage it.""""We’re not going back to the hyperinflation period of the 1970s,"" Lampe adds. ""We’re in a much more global world now.”Many economists have argued that the leap in prices is a byproduct of a reopening economy and should abate by next year.Still worried? Here's what you can doIf you’re fearful this bout of inflation will stick around longer than expected, there are ways to protect your nest egg. Investments in real estate, commodities and gold can help offset higher inflation, wealth manager say.Real estate, for instance, can gain value amid inflation, while property owners can increase rent on tenants. Real estate investment trusts have also offered attractive returns in prior periods of rising inflation.Commodities historically do well when the U.S. dollar is weak and higher inflation tends to push the greenback lower.“Inflation is inevitable, especially with the amount of money the government is spending,” says Patrick Healey, founder and president of Caliber Financial Partners, a financial planning firm. “From a financial standpoint, you do need to have some hedges in your portfolio.”If you want to beat inflation over the long run, stick with stocks, says Detrick.Since 1950, the average annual inflation rate based on the consumer price index has been 3.5%, while the S&P 500 has returned more than 9% annually, according to LPL Financial.If you want to be more targeted, value stocks tend to benefit from higher inflation, experts say. Materials and energy companies stand to benefit from higher commodities prices, while higher interest rates tend to help financial stocks with higher profit margins. What about cryptos to hedge inflation?As for other alternative assets, some wealth managers prefer gold as a hedge against inflation over cryptocurrencies like bitcoins, which suffered another swoon recently.Since 2010, the S&P 500 has tallied 10 trading days with declines of 5% or more while gold has suffered one such hit, according to Glenmede, an asset management firm. Bitcoin has notched 455 trading days of 5% moves in either direction in the past 11 years.In the past two bear markets, Bitcoin fell just as much as the S&P 500, if not twice as much. So just when investors needed it to protect their portfolios most in a downturn, it failed in that regard, says Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.""We're not on the crypto bandwagon just yet,"" Reynolds says. ""There's so much speculative activity in that corner of the market. It's not something we're comfortable with.""",author,date

They include General Motors and Mercedes-Benz.Typically, when drivers take their eyes off the road for more than a few seconds, the systems sound an alert. In GM's Cadillac Super Cruise system, the vehicle will even come to a complete halt if the driver doesn't respond. It was not immediately clear how Tesla's system would respond.Tesla's move was disclosed in an over-the-air update distributed to its vehicles, according to social media photos first reported by several tech publications, including TechCrunch and The Verge.No more driving distractions?:Augmented reality windshields coming to Kia, Audi and more could change the way we driveWhat's open on Memorial Day?:Walmart, Home Depot open; Costco closed MondayIt comes after Tesla recently came under scrutiny following a deadly crash in Texas involving one of its vehicles, which called attention to the fact that drivers can trick Autopilot into thinking someone's behind the wheel even if they're not. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Autopilot was not activated when that accident occurred.Tesla owners have posted photos to YouTube showing themselves abusing the technology by, for example, riding in the back seat while the vehicle is driving itself.Tesla did not respond to a request seeking comment about the camera decision.In the wireless update calling the upgrades ""Autopilot Improvements,"" Tesla told owners: ""The cabin camera above your rearview mirror can now detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged. Camera data does not leave the car itself, which means the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled,"" according to social media posts. Previously, the camera would only send a few seconds of video before a collision – and even then, only if the user had enabled the camera function.Watchdogs have called for the company to both enable the system to monitor drivers while they're using Autopilot while also protecting their privacy.“If Tesla has the ability to determine if the driver isn't paying attention, it needs to warn the driver in the moment, like other automakers already do,” Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports’ auto test center, said in a CR report in March.You can follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey and subscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter here for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday morning.",author,date

Timed notifications would be a good solution. Upgrades to widgetsI enjoy having a Spotify app as a widget on my iPhone. What I don't like is that it's basically just a giant app icon. Yes, I can see what most recent playlist is available, but I wouldn't mind playing directly from the widget without opening the app. It works with your notifications. Why not make these widgets more active?Split screen optionsI admit this one is going to be tricky for iPhone since you have some models with smaller sizes and there's only so much real estate on your screen. But I'd love a way to use two apps at once.

We are looking to purchase any and all price range vehicles. However, we need Subaru Outbacks to replenish our inventory. We are willing to make an aggressive offer for this vehicle.""Welcome to car market in 2021, a time when demand is high but supply is seriously crimped because of a global shortage of semiconductor chips that are used in everything from cars to consumer electronics like the popular Sony PlayStation 5, leaving dealers scrambling to find vehicles where they can.  The lack of chips has put a squeeze on automakers, prompting them in many cases to prioritize their most profitable models by cutting production on others, changing some of the components they place in their cars, delivering fewer vehicles to dealerships and offering lease pullback deals.Save better, spend better:Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up for free here.No more driving distractions:New windshields coming to Kia, Audi and more could change the way we driveCar shortages at dealershipsAll that has left dealers short on inventory, ready to buy and warning consumers to plan ahead.  A representative for a large dealership group in metro Detroit,  who offered to talk about the situation but only without his name being used, said his group in some cases is taking on 12 to 18 months of lease payments if customers want out. The group is shifting resources to vehicle acquisition so it can have vehicles to sell because what's available is so limited. A customer might want a Ford Bronco Sport in red, for example, but will end up getting it in blue or silver.The dealership representative described the situation as a double-edged sword.""From a profitability standpoint, things have never been better. (Customers) are definitely paying MSRP or more,"" he said, referencing the manufacturer's suggested retail price. ""(But) costs are through the roof...The only positive light is if you want to sell, there's no better time to sell.""Buyers need to plan aheadInventory at dealerships is tighter than during the 2019 GM strike or the COVID-19 shutdowns last year, said Katie Bowman Coleman of Bowman Chevrolet near Clarkston. She said she's advising drivers to get in touch at least six months from when they need a new car. ""That’s the timeline now to place an order, to get in the queue to get exactly what you want,"" Bowman Coleman said. ""There’s still vehicles coming in all the time, but most of them are spoken for when they get here.” Experts say being flexible can mean the difference between getting a vehicle now or having to wait. It can help, too, if car buyers are willing to consider more than one model.“People are kind of discovering new models they didn’t necessarily think they were coming in to buy,” Coleman said.The dealership uses a vehicle tracking system from GM that helps monitor what’s available and where a specific vehicle is. That way if someone can’t wait for a specific vehicle, she can see what else is available.“We really just are trying to, customer by customer, assess their needs, go over options and be right there by their side as we’re trying to figure it out,” Coleman said, noting that those options can include extending a lease, giving someone a loaner or directing them to other models. The dealership's vehicle buying team is ""more active now probably than ever,"" she said. ""We certainly go after everything we can. It’s not easy. It’s tough out there. Everyone's holding on to what they have,"" Coleman said.She noted that the dealership sold about 300 new and 120 used vehicles last month. It's usually higher, but that's still a good month, she said.Coleman said she’s heard from dealer friends of examples of people paying more than the MSRP for a car.Do car customers have any leverage?Consumers do have some protection against uncertainty in this tight market.GM, for instance, offers a way to lock in a current incentive if a specific vehicle a consumer is buying isn't ready yet. The deal does not prevent a buyer from claiming a better incentive if that's available when the vehicle arrives. GM spokesman Dave Caldwell said the offer is handled through an incentive acknowledgment form.Nicole Urban of Oakland County in Michigan recently visited the Bowman Chevrolet dealership planning to buy a used vehicle to replace her 2011 Mazda. But Urban, who works in the healthcare industry, opted for a lease instead.After test driving a Trailblazer and a Blazer, she decided to lease a black 2021 Blazer because she preferred the larger size and it was a cheaper monthly payment. This was Urban’s first time shopping at a dealership; she bought the Mazda from her parents, and although Urban said she loved the car, she wanted a new vehicle with the latest safety features.“What I liked most was that the salespeople were honest about the market and how the parts shortages were affecting what models were readily available,” she said. At Matick Automotive Group in Michigan, Paul Zimmermann, vice president and owner, said availability for some models appears to depend on how many extra features they have.Heated seats, high-end pickups are scarceCars with heated seats, heated steering wheels and navigation tend to be affected because more options mean a greater need for chips.Zimmermann's Chevrolet and Toyota dealerships in Michigan aren’t seeing as many high-end pickups, for instance, and inventory is “severely constrained” at the moment.“I would say we probably have 35% of what we would typically have available to us on the Chevy end and maybe 50-60% available on the Toyota side,” Zimmermann said.He noted that GM and Toyota appear to be taking somewhat different approaches. GM has been trying to protect its hottest models, and Toyota has slowed its deliveries but not greatly reduced any specific models.With prices up on new cars, used cars have followed suit.Zimmermann called it economics 101. When demand and prices increase for new cars, the same happens for the used market.“All boats rise up, so to speak,” he said.A deal to be hadWhile no one likes to pay more for their vehicles, higher prices mean customers get more for their trade-ins.“It’s not a negative, I think, for the consumer because they’re getting more for the asset they’re selling, trading in. In some respects, they’re getting more than they otherwise probably would have in the past or I’d say normal times. Yet they might pay more for the new, so in some respects, it’s a little bit of a wash,” Zimmermann said, noting the situation is affecting leases, too.Zimmermann said many customers typically get out of their leases early, but the current climate has shifted that even more. Customers are making a change earlier than normal or at least considering it more because of concerns about what the inventory will look like, and the dealerships are also interested in getting cars back so they can add to their stock.“We‘ve had a number that have probably been a year out, that we have bought them out of that vehicle early to take advantage of putting that vehicle on our used car lot and then conversely the customer has relieved themselves of any concern for what the future looks like to potentially deal with a shortage in eight, nine, 10 months if that’s when they were going to get out of it,” Zimmermann said.Why are used car prices high?There might be no better time to sell a vehicle, but the cost to buy is up, too.The average listing for used cars “surpassed the $22,000 mark for the first time ever in April, closing the month at a new high of $22,568,” and average transaction prices on new vehicles are up as well, to $40,768, an $864 increase from April 2020, according to Cox Automotive.“It’s really basic economics,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive. The chip shortage is hitting inventories at a time of high demand, but production never fully rebounded after the pandemic started. The annual fluctuations in the vehicle market are still at play as well, but new pressures have entered the picture this year, she said.“Used car sales and used car prices always go up when the tax refunds are coming in. This time you have the double whammy of tax refunds and the stimulus,” Krebs said, referencing the direct payments to Americans that were part of the federal government’s efforts to boost the economy.The chip shortage, Krebs said, got its start when automakers and suppliers responded to the initial phase of the pandemic by canceling orders for chips because they assumed demand would crash. “But demand was stunningly strong,” she said. What happened to the computer chip market?Although many people suffered financial losses related to the pandemic, the impact was not felt evenly across the economy. Some people even had more money on hand, which they could spend on vehicles, in part, because they weren't spending as much on things like entertainment. Personal vehicles also became the go-to choice for those with money and concerns about social distancing on other forms of transportation.When those in the auto industry tried to reinstate their chip orders, makers of video games and other electronics were already in line, Krebs said.“It’s just almost like the perfect storm,” said Martin French, the U.S. managing director for Berylls Strategy Advisors, a global automotive consulting firm.Consumer electronics, with people stuck at home and working more than ever on screens, quickly filled the void in chip orders. But the chip supply was also hit by unexpected difficulties, such as a fire at a plant in Japan this spring, Martin said. Now, the optimism of a reopening economy in the United States and the United Kingdom, for instance,   added even more pressure.“There’s so much pent-up demand for products, to spend money, to get a new car, to get a new phone, to get new product in the household. It’s all coming together, and the industries are going to be fighting each other quite frankly for these products because you just can’t build a manufacturing plant or extend them big enough for these parts that are in such short supply,” French said.The chip shortage, however, is one part of a series of unexpected challenges.“We just can’t (get) our hands on that tiny, tiny little chip that goes in and makes so many of the components work, and then if we can, then there’s a storm in Dallas or a fire in Japan or there’s another war breaking out or a trade war going on. You just can’t make this up,” French said.Missing partsBruce Wendt, 69, of Romeo, Michigan, started shopping for a new pickup earlier this month before pausing.Wendt, who retired from the Air Force in 2008, has 72,000 miles on his 2015 Ford F-150 despite taking it on an annual round trip to Arizona six times. It’s a 4,200-mile trek and he’d like to upgrade to a V-8 engine, plus he is intrigued with the 2021 GMC Sierra’s new multi-pro tailgate. His nephew works for General Motors, so Wendt could get a family discount.He went to three local dealerships and quickly learned that the vehicle he wanted was being made without the fuel management module, which boosts fuel economy, due to the chip shortage.“They had a truck I liked, and I was ready to pull the trigger on it, but it just didn’t feel right,” Wendt said of his shopping experience. “It felt like I didn’t have all the facts.”For one thing, the dealers couldn’t tell him whether  GM could install the fuel management module on the pickup after he bought it if it came into supply. The answer is no, according to GM.And GM is taking only $50 off the price of the pickup if it lacks the fuel management module, Wendt said. It’s hardly a savings because “you chew that up in gas in no time,” he said.“I started thinking about ...  a couple of things I wanted that I can’t get because of the chip shortage,” Wendt said. “You can’t get the lane alert, that’s something they don’t have. I can live without that, but the V-8, if it doesn’t have that Dynamic Fuel Management and it gets like 16 MPG, it’s not that good.”Despite a dealer offering Wendt $23,500 for his F-150 trade-in, which he considered generous, Wendt said he’ll keep it for now.GM isn’t the only company that has changed the features in its vehicles in response to the chip crisis.Stellantis, the company formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Peugeot-maker PSA Group, has made its own adjustments. The Wall Street Journal, quoting a dealer, reported that the company shipped some trucks “without an electronic blind-spot detection system.” There have been other reports about changes to the Ram 1500, as well, but the company has refused to shed light on the issue to the Free Press, providing a general comment that “Stellantis employees across the enterprise are finding creative solutions every day to minimize the impact to our vehicles.”The unnamed dealer representative who spoke to the Free Press said his Ram dealership can’t order one particular option package, but the Ram 1500s that have been arriving at the dealership have not been missing any parts.Ford spokesman Said Deep said the automaker is ""not currently building and shipping products without certain equipment and features, but we’re looking at it closely.""Sam Fiorani, vice president of Global Vehicle Forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, explained that these kinds of changes are based on a clear rationale.“With the Active Fuel Management system removed from the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, GM can continue to build some of its trucks. Nissan has removed navigation from some of its products and Stellantis is swapping digital instrument clusters for analog clusters in the Peugeot 308 compacts.""There are certainly more examples like this,” he said.Staff writers Phoebe Wall Howard and Christina Hall contributed to this report.

If all goes well, summer vacation season could be off to a banner start, and life might finally start resembling something closer to ""normal."" But the sudden freedom to travel again doesn't mean it's all smooth sailing. Airfares are on the rise, rental cars are in short supply, and hotel room rates are skyrocketing. Even finding an available – and affordable – vacation home or campsite near many popular destinations in the U.S. can feel like a new form of doomscrolling.Luckily, there are some incredible tech tools to help you get around all kinds of potential travel troubles so that you can – finally! – take that vacation you've been dreaming about. Masks off, vacation on?No matter where you go or how you plan to get there this summer – planes, trains, automobiles, eBikes – you still need to pack a mask. At this time, the federal mask mandate for public transportation remains in effect until Sept. 13. That means anyone over the age of two has to wear a mask on any form of public transit – including airport terminals, buses, and ferries – or any public space people use for mass travel.What about everywhere else? The AARP has an excellent state-by-state guide to face mask requirements. Be sure to bookmark this before your trip. ► Pro tips: I've traveled a lot – primarily for work – during the pandemic. One of my friends introduced me to Zeiss antiFOG spray and biodegradable wipes on a recent trip to Antigua, and it was a total lifesaver. It's inexpensive and keeps your face shield, glasses, sunglasses, or even snorkel mask clean and fog-free for a full 24 hours. No rental cars? No problemGood luck finding rental cars available – or even remotely affordable – in many places in June, July, and August. Rental car companies sold off a large portion of their fleets during the pandemic and have yet to restock for rising demand. ►Pro tips: Try peer-to-peer auto rental app Turo. Similar to the Airbnb business model, if someone has a car they're not using, and it meets Turo's standards and safety requirements, you're welcome to rent it. The price you get quoted upfront includes the rental cost, insurance, cleaning fees – all of it – so there's no sticker shock. The company even has 24/7 roadside assistance. There's also Outdoorsy, which uses the same concept, but for van, camper, and all kinds of other recreational vehicle rentals. I've used this service several times since first covering its launch in 2015, and we're using it again for a trip to Denali National Park with family in July. We were able to find a new-ish camper that sleeps four, is dog friendly and is available for a fraction of the cost of traditional RV rentals. Other peer-to-peer vehicle rentals are available in specific locations, such as Getaround for cars and trucks, Cabana and Roamerica for vans, and RVezy or RVShare for campers. ►A $750 car rental for three days? Don't wait to book a rental car and other tips to avoid sticker shockNo room at the campsiteOnce you get your RV, or tent, or even a roomy car, you might have trouble finding a place to park or pitch it. According to the CEO of camping app The Dyrt, some 100 million Americans plan to escape to the great outdoors this year. Reservations at many popular national parks such as Alaska's Denali and Yosemite in California  are either already full or getting there – and in some cases, even areas near the parks are running out of room. ►Pro tips: Several apps help pair campers with safe sites these days, but for quality and variety, it's hard to beat Hipcamp. I just used it to find an alternative place to park an RV when our family visits Denali National Park in mid-July. The company works primarily with private landowners to list thousands of sites tailored to meet specific needs, from RV hookups to more remote glamping bungalows. Additional alternatives include Tentrr, Harvest Hosts, GlampingHub, Pitchup, and Campspot. Many of these apps and websites let you browse by amenities – does the site have a hot shower? Is it child- and pet-friendly? – and see reviews. They also cater more to glampers with all-inclusive canvas tents, yurts, tree houses, and even vintage trailer options on private land. While you can't book directly through the Dyrt app, it offers detailed information and links for more than a million locations around the country, including RV sites, state and national parks, and even free dispersed camping sites on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land.  (The Dyrt's Pro subscription lets you you use the app offline, which could be handy if you expect to be in an area with scant wireless connectivity.)  Finally, Campendium and Freecampsites.net have also mapped out established sites where you can pitch a tent in the woods, with no fee and no reservations.For a starting price of $10 (subscriptions are also available), the Campnab app will send you a text message when the campground of your choosing has an opening on your requested dates. The app scans more than 7,000 campgrounds for cancellations and has recently added hard-to-get backcountry permits, too. Budget-breakersMore than three-quarters of Americans (77%) plan to take trips this summer, according to the latest results of a Harris Poll survey. Several other traveler-sentiment surveys show nearly 70% of those polled are willing to spend a lot more money this year, too – as much as $7,000 per vacation. ►Pro Tips: If you can commit to a payment plan versus shelling out a large sum of money upfront for your big trip, you might want to research buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) vacation options. I just booked a rental home in Lake Tahoe for a mid-week work trip through Vacasa this way with a 0% interest offer for six months through a service called Affirm, which launched an updated travel page last week.It lets you spread out the cost of RV rentals, accommodations, experiences, and more into biweekly or monthly payments with Expedia, Vrbo, Priceline, Delta Vacations, and others. In an email, a company spokesperson wrote, ""It helps people stay on stay on budget by letting you pay overtime on a schedule that works best for you, with interest options as low as 0% APR. It also shows the total cost of your purchase upfront in simple dollars and never charges you more than you agree to."" Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst for Creditcards.com, told Investopedia recently that BNPL offers ""an enticing mix of instant gratification and financing. If you split it into installments, it feels more affordable, rather than incurring massive, ongoing debt,"" he said.But as USA TODAY Travel pointed out in another article recently, be sure to find a better interest rate than the one you might already have with a traditional credit card, and don't bite off more than you can chew, so to speak.► ‘Book your dream trip now.

Augmented reality windshields coming to Kia, Audi and more could change the way we drive","The days of drivers sneaking dangerous downward glances at directions on their phones may soon come to an end.Automakers are poised to introduce technology on new cars, trucks and SUVs that projects directions onto the windshield and draws a circle around pedestrians or deer on the roadway.Depending on the vehicle, these augmented reality windshields may also display vehicle information, identify ice patches and, eventually, serve as a screen for entertainment purposes when self-driving cars become a reality.Brands poised to debut the technology include Kia, Hyundai, Cadillac and Audi.Advocates say that the windshields show how technology can be used to reduce driver distraction, keeping drivers' eyes on the road instead of darting toward an infotainment screen or phone.Save better, spend better:  Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up for free hereSanta Cruz, Telluride, Taos:Why automakers are naming vehicles after American destinationsSafety watchdogs say the systems could help improve safety, but they're keen to see the details before signing off.Many automakers already have a scaled-down version of augmented reality incorporated into their windshields in the form of what they call ""heads-up display,"" which typically features a small box containing information projected onto the screen.Experts say more advanced augmented reality windshields will become the norm.""It's going to be ubiquitous,"" said Gary Silberg, automotive sector lead at consultancy KPMG, who has advised automakers and suppliers on their plans for augmented reality windshields. ""This is going to be a massive market. Every screen in every vehicle, every windshield will have something at some point in time.""Here are answers to key questions about the technology:What models will soon carry augmented reality windshields?The recently revealed Kia EV6 and Audi Q4 e-tron will be among the first when they arrive in 2022.Kia's sibling brand, Hyundai, will also debut an augmented reality windshield on the  2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5.And General Motors will introduce one on the 2023 Cadillac Lyriq.All four vehicles are electric crossovers.What will it look like?The systems will vary depending on the automaker.The Kia EV6, which goes on sale in early 2022, will have an augmented reality display capable of displaying ""turn-by-turn navigation with animated graphics to better illustrate to the driver the intended course direction, lane safety info, and a front vehicle indicator,"" Kia spokesperson Karla Gonzalez said in an email.On the Audi Q4 e-tron's augmented reality heads-up display, information ""is displayed dynamically in a large field of view, where it appears in a virtual, floating image at a perceived distance of roughly 30 feet or more from the driver – creating an integrated and eyes-forward experience,"" Audi said in a statement.At the virtual Consumer Electronics Show in January, Panasonic Automotive introduced a system that projected 3D information ""into the driver’s line of sight to help reduce driver distraction and potentially increase safety on the road.""Will it make it safer to drive?The Panasonic system will deploy bright graphics overlaid on the road, helping drivers identify objects or signs. For example, it could help people spot deer they might not otherwise notice with the naked eye.Using eye-tracking technology, the system knows how high the motorist is perched to ensure the project visuals align with the driver's line of sight. Andrew Poliak, chief technology officer of Panasonic Automotive, said the company is aiming to debut the system on 2024 model-year vehicles.""It’s meant to be tuned to what you need to know at that particular time and keep your eyes adjusted and focused on the road ahead,"" Poliak said.The ability to spot potential safety threats is a very enticing element of augmented reality windshields, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights.""If the sensors detect a pedestrian about to cross in front of you, it can highlight that pedestrian,"" said Abuelsamid, who conducts research on automotive technology. ""It might put a box or some sort of highlight around where the pedestrian is.""Keeping the driver's eyes on the road is one of the primary focuses of safety watchdogs, who point to independent studies showing that in-vehicle infotainment can distract, putting passengers, other motorists and pedestrians at risk.Are safety watchdogs satisfied?Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said he's waiting to see how well-augmented reality windshields actually work before making a judgment call on whether the systems help improve safety.“Like all driver assist systems, the devil is in the details,"" Levine said in an email. ""Some added features, for which manufacturers usually charge a premium, have been shown to be more of a distraction than an aid. If the technology works, and if it does so in a non-distracting fashion, it could keep driver’s eyes focused on the road and has the potential to increase safety.""What will it cost?Pricing is unclear. Like most technology, it's likely to cost more when it's first deployed and then go down in price over time.An augmented reality windshield may start as an upgrade in the thousand-dollar range but could soon fall into the hundreds and possibly eventually tumble below a hundred, Abuelsamid said.Will the government allow it?At this point, it looks like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no problems with systems that are on the near horizon.In general, the agency has taken a hands-off approach to the development of cutting-edge vehicle technology in recent years, such as self-driving cars, by providing guidance rather than firm restrictions.NHTSA said in a 2016 guidance document that advanced heads-up display systems ""have potential for presenting critical information, especially if the message has a spatial component.""That said, if automakers push the limits, they could run into a regulatory wall.How will these systems evolve?Someday, when self-driving cars advance to a point where drivers no longer need to keep their hands on the wheel, the windshield could be poised for further evolution.Silberg said consumer electronics companies like Apple could integrate touch-screen capability and entertainment options, such as movie streaming.Imagine watching the next Marvel movie on your windshield while riding in a robotaxi.""We’re at the early stages,"" Silberg said. ""I think it will be used in a different way than we can imagine today.""You can follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey and subscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter here for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday morning.",author,date
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/05/28/solarwinds-hackers-linked-russia-target-usaid-email-accounts/7484787002/,Russia-linked SolarWinds hackers target email accounts used by State Department aid agency,"Hackers with suspected ties to the Russian government launched new assaults on human rights groups and government agencies, including email accounts used by the State Department's international aid agency, Microsoft revealed late Thursday. Microsoft Vice President Tom Burt disclosed the breach in a blog post, saying the ""wave of attacks"" targeted about 3,000 email accounts across 24 countries, at more than 150 organizations involved in international development and humanitarian work.The U.S. received the largest share of attacks, Burt said. The discovery of the cyberattack comes just a few weeks before President Joe Biden is due to meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Geneva and adds to the growing list of complaints Biden is likely to bring up with Putin in Switzerland. Geneva summit: Biden to meet with Putin on June 16 in SwitzerlandWhat is Nobelium?""These attacks appear to be a continuation of multiple efforts by Nobelium to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts,"" Burt, who is Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust, wrote in the post.Microsoft said Nobelium is the same group responsible for the SolarWinds hack, a sweeping cyberattack that compromised at least half a dozen U.S. federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Energy Department, as well as thousands of companies in the private sector. U.S. intelligence agencies believe the SolarWinds hack is the work of SVR, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.  Biden last month expelled Russian diplomats and announced new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the massive SolarWinds hacking operation, which began in early 2020 but was only discovered in December that same year. GCHQ, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, also believes the Kremlin was likely behind the SolarWinds breach. Russia denies any involvement in the SolarWinds hack, but SVR director Sergei Naryshkin said in mid-May that he was ""flattered"" by the accusations from Washington and London. Russia has not commented on the new Nobelium hacking allegations.  SolarWinds:Russia expels US diplomats in response to Washington's similar action Microsoft did not disclose precisely how successful the new breach by Nobelium was, saying only that ""many of the attacks targeting our customers were blocked automatically."" It added that ""Windows Defender is blocking the malware involved in this attack."" Microsoft said the cyberattack operation involved sending phishing emails made to resemble legitimate ones, but engineered to deliver harmful files.  ""We have no reason to believe these attacks involve any exploit against or vulnerability in Microsoft’s products or services,"" it said. The assault appeared largely aimed at U.S. and international humanitarian think tanks, consultancies and agencies who have been critical of Russia's crackdown on democracy activists such as Alexey Navalny, who was jailed in Russia in February for breaking parole conditions despite being in Germany where he was receiving treatment for poisoning with a Russian-made military grade nerve agent called Novichok.'Putin is turning his main threat into a martyr':'Will Russia's attack on Alexei Navalny, journalists and 5,700 detained Russians backfire?Phishing attempt included Trump 'election fraud' emails as lureIn one example of the attempted phishing breach highlighted by Microsoft, an email that appears to originate from a USAID email account claims that ""Donald Trump has published new emails on election fraud."" If the recipient of that email were to click on the link supplied it would place malicious files on the user's computer, Microsoft said. The technology giant said Nobelium was able to launch the new assault after gaining access to an email marketing service used by USAID, or the United States Agency for International Development. USAID is the main American government agency responsible for delivering foreign civilian aid and development assistance. It is an independent agency, but formally administered by the State Department. USAID's acting spokesperson Pooja Jhunjhunwala said the agency was ""aware of potentially malicious email activity"" and that a ""forensic investigation into this security incident is ongoing."" The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, said: ""We are aware of the potential compromise at USAID through an email marketing platform and are working with the FBI and USAID to better understand the extent of the compromise and assist potential victims.""Jamil Jaffer, a former Associate White House Counsel to President George W. Bush and now an executive at IronNet Cybersecurity, which advises companies on how to defend themselves against hacking, said in emailed comments that the new assault reported by Microsoft ""could provide the Russians with sustained access to (and intelligence on) all sorts of third parties that the U.S. government works with through"" USAID. The White House has not commented. Terry Thompson, an expert in cybersecurity at Johns Hopkins University, described the suspected state-sponsored SolarWinds hack as ""one of the most devastating cyberattacks in history."" But the U.S. has also been contending with what appears to be increasingly bold assaults from private Russia-based cyberattack gangs. The FBI believes, for example, that the main culprit of a ransomware attack called DarkSide that in early May shutdown Colonial Pipeline, the U.S.'s largest fuel pipeline, is a Russian cybercrime criminal network that operates by the same name. Biden-Putin meeting: Add this to the list?The scheduled June 16 face-to-face encounter between Biden and Putin in Switzerland will take place against the backdrop of a long tense relationship between Washington and Moscow that is off to a rocky start under the Biden administration. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said no formal preconditions or talking points have been set for the meeting. However, in addition to allegations over the Kremlins's tacit or explicit endorsement of hacking attacks, the agenda will almost certainly extend to Russia's territorial aggressions in neighboring Ukraine, a forced diversion this week of a Lithuania-bound commercial flight by Russian-ally Belarus so that the latter could arrest a dissident-journalist, and Navalny's ongoing detention.Opinion:To face Russia and Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden needs a smart strategyThe summit is likely also to touch on Russia's work on a gas pipeline called Nord Stream 2 that the U.S. has determined is a threat to European energy security, efforts by both nations to stem the coronavirus pandemic, and assessments by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia is the main suspect in connection with a group of U.S. diplomats and government employees suffering from ""Havana Syndrome,"" a mysterious neurological condition whose symptoms include headaches, tinnitus and balance issues.The syndrome, potentially the result of directed microwave energy that could be part of a futuristic weapon possibly under development by Russia, was first discovered at the U.S. embassy in Cuba in 2018. Russia adamantly denies any involvement. Unexplained illnesses connected to the syndrome have since expanded to U.S. government workers and their families in China, Western Europe and even in the U.S.",author,date

A new report from Advance Democracy shared exclusively with USA TODAY found that warning labels or links to credible information are frequently missing from posts that deny the existence of climate change, dispute its causes or underplay its effects.Among them is the false belief that the Grand Solar Minimum, a period of low solar activity, will cool the planet and cause the next ice age, which is particularly popular among prominent climate change deniers and even has its own YouTube channel.Michael Mann, director of Penn State University’s Earth System Science Center, warned that fossil fuel interests are weaponizing social media platforms to sow doubt and division and suppress public support for climate change initiatives.He called on tech companies to identify, flag and take down accounts that repeatedly push climate lies and keep misinformation from spreading largely unchecked.“Nothing less than the future of this planet is at stake,” Mann, author of “The New Climate War,” told USA TODAY.YouTube influencers reject vaccine lies:France praises social media influencers over foiled Pfizer vaccine smearHow to hide likes on Facebook, Instagram:Instagram and Facebook will let users hide 'likes' on postsOn Twitter in 2020, there were nearly a half-million climate change denial posts, according to Advance Democracy, a research organization that studies disinformation and extremism. This year, there have been 83,590, and climate change denial content surged during the Texas blackout in February and President Joe Biden’s climate change summit in April.Twitter climate change deniers seize on global cooling mythPosts with the hashtag #GrandSolarMinimum accounted for nearly 9% of all climate change denial content on Twitter, the report found. The posts pointed to cold snaps around the world, including in Greenland, as purported evidence that the Grand Solar Minimum – a period during which the sun gives off less energy – is cooling the globe.Scientists said the Grand Solar Minimum, which reduces average temperatures by a half a degree Fahrenheit or less, does little to offset global warming, yet all of the top five Twitter accounts pushing climate change denial promote claim it does.“We recognize more can be done on services like Twitter to elevate credible climate information, including on how we can mitigate climate crisis harms,” Twitter said in a statement. “Our teams are thinking about ways we can best serve the global climate crisis conversation happening on the service, including through tools that surface and make reliable information and resources more readily available.”Texas winter storm, California wildfires fuel climate misinformationTo promote public skepticism, climate change deniers seize on extreme weather events, such as the Texas winter storm, when some people falsely claimed the snow was fake, or the California wildfires some said were the result of space lasers.When millions of Texans lost power in February, Facebook users racked up millions of views posting that wind turbines caused the massive outages, and the social media site didn't label the claims as false, according to a report from nonprofit activist network Avaaz, shared exclusively with USA TODAY.Mark Zuckerberg admitted at a congressional hearing in March that climate misinformation is a big issue, but when Rep. Donald McEachin, D-Va., asked why Facebook didn't apply the same rules to climate change as COVID-19 misinformation, the Facebook CEO said lies about the pandemic had the potential to cause “imminent physical harm,” while climate misinformation does not.A Facebook spokesman said climate change misinformation accounts for a small percentage of overall misinformation on company platforms butdeclined to be specific.John Cook,  a research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University who advises Facebook, said social media platforms must quickly develop effective solutions to climate misinformation the way they did for COVID-19. “COVID-19 misinformation is an obvious immediate threat, and social media platforms were appropriately proactive in quickly responding and stopping it from spreading. Similarly, climate change is an immediate threat as climate impacts are happening here and now, all across society and our environment,” Cook said. “But unlike the pandemic, climate change is going to persist and increase in intensity over time. This underscores why it's imperative that social media platforms are proactive and urgent in stopping climate misinformation from spreading.”Scientists urge Facebook and YouTube to crack down on climate liesSocial media researchers said it’s hard to get a handle on the volume of climate misinformation without access to private groups and messages.Advance Democracy found that some of the most popular climate change deniers on Twitter also have accounts on Facebook and Instagram. Advance Democracy uncovered about 4,210 public posts about the Grand Solar Minimum since 2020 that generated about 97,100 interactions.  Last fall, Facebook created a Climate Science Information Center. At the time, Facebook’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, told USA TODAY, “Our goal is to help people get authoritative information about climate change, and we are taking it seriously. This is one step, and there will be many more.”The center pops up when users search terms such as “global warming.” It includes scientific statements, such as nearly all global warming is caused by humans, and busts common climate-change myths. Facebook has begun to add links to the center on climate-change-related posts in some places and plans to expand. Fact checkers bird-dog bogus claims such as that the net gain of global temperatures over the past 58 years is zero, the World Wildlife Fund funded fires in the Amazon and sea level rates haven’t significantly changed in the last 120 years. “When they rate this content as false, we add a warning label and reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also take action against Pages, Groups, and accounts that repeatedly share false claims about climate science,” Facebook told USA TODAY in a statement.YouTube, owned by Google, was singled out as a top source for climate misinformation by the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. The committee urged YouTube to take more aggressive steps to fight back. Advance Democracy found that videos on one channel about Grand Solar Minimum had more than 4.7 million views.YouTube told USA TODAY that it surfaces authoritative content in search results and informational panels to reduce the spread of misinformation. “For example, searching for videos about climate change or even climate-related conspiracies brings up results from authoritative sources and information panels where users can find additional context,” Elena Hernandez, a YouTube spokesperson, said in a statement. Advance Democracy said informational panels don't pop up on searches for the Grand Solar Minimum.Now accepting reader submissions:Creating a gaming community at USA TODAYOn TikTok, Advance Democracy found 14 videos tagged with the hashtag #GrandSolarMinimum that received more than 150,000 views as of April 26. TikTok said it works to keep “misleading, harmful or deceptive content and accounts off TikTok.”“We work proactively to identify and remove misinformation and accounts dedicated to spreading it, and we review reports from our community,” the company said. “This includes misinformation related to climate change, vaccines, COVID-19, and more.”Daniel Jones, president of Advance Democracy, said climate misinformation that obfuscates or downplays the threat to human life delays “necessary policy reforms worldwide.”“Our research affirms that the spread of climate misinformation is prolific on social media and could benefit from platform interventions that steer users to more accurate information,” he said.",author,date

https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/05/27/facebook-youtube-twitter-florida-lawsuit-censorship-law-trump-conservatives/7468779002/,"Facebook, YouTube and Twitter lawsuit challenges Trump-inspired Florida law banning ‘censorship' of conservatives","Calling it a “frontal assault on the First Amendment,” a federal lawsuit is seeking to strike down a Florida law that penalizes social media companies for barring the speech of political candidates, USA TODAY has learned.Two technology trade groups, NetChoice and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, sued the state Thursday in Tallahassee federal court on grounds that the law it crafted to thwart alleged censorship of conservative viewpoints and voices violates the Constitution, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by USA TODAY. The tech industry’s lawsuit alleges the Florida law infringes on the First Amendment rights of online businesses and is preempted by a federal law that shields internet companies from being sued for how they moderate content.Signed Monday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, the law is the first of its kind to crack down on Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube for unfairly restricting or removing conservative content from their platforms, a charge the companies deny.“If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will now be held accountable,” DeSantis, a possible 2024 presidential contender and ally of former President Donald Trump, said in a statement Monday.But the lawsuit alleges that Florida is the one attempting to censor free speech and expression by compelling social media companies to host speech and speakers they disagree with.""Rather than preventing what it calls 'censorship,' the Act does the exact opposite: it empowers government officials in Florida to police the protected editorial judgment of online businesses that the State disfavors and whose perceived political viewpoints it wishes to punish,"" the lawsuit says. ""The Act is a frontal assault on the First Amendment and an extraordinary intervention by the government in the free marketplace of ideas that would be unthinkable for traditional media, book sellers, lending libraries, or newsstands.""'The future of this planet is at stake':New report pressures Facebook, YouTube and Twitter to battle climate liesGeorge Floyd activism:One year after George Floyd's death, two-thirds of workers want their companies to speak out against racismDeSantis' press secretary Christina Pushaw would not comment on the lawsuit but said the governor anticipated legal challenges. ""Big Tech is in some ways more powerful than government, and certainly less accountable. Free speech is a sacred right for all Americans. It is recognized that government has a role in protecting consumers against discrimination and deceptive/unfair trade practices, and this law is within that authority to rein in a powerful entity that oversteps individuals’ free speech rights,"" she said in a statement. ""We are confident that this new legislation has a strong legal basis and protects Floridians’ constitutional rights.""Under the law, which takes effect July 1, the state can fine large social media companies $250,000 a day if they remove an account of a statewide political candidate and $25,000 a day if they remove the account of someone seeking local office. It requires social media companies to notify users within seven days that they could be censored, giving them time to correct posts.The law targets internet businesses with more than 100 million monthly users but made an exception for Disney and its platforms by exempting theme park owners. It also allows Florida residents to sue online businesses for up to $100,000 if they feel they’ve been treated unfairly.The lawsuit alleges Florida’s restrictions on social media companies are a “blatant attack” on the content moderation choices they make daily to protect the public and advertisers from pornography, terrorist incitement, false propaganda spread by foreign actors, calls for genocide or race-based violence, COVID-19 vaccines disinformation, fraudulent schemes and other harmful, offensive or illegal material. Law professor: Florida law 'obviously unconstitutional'Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, says the Florida law was bound to draw legal challenges as some of the new law’s provisions are “obviously unconstitutional.”“The Supreme Court has made it clear that publishers have the freedom to pick and choose what content they want to publish, and the bill blatantly seeks to strip publishers of that freedom,” he said. “Florida residents should expect better from their legislators, and now they see their tax dollars spent defending an indefensible bill that never should have passed.”Similar bills are under consideration in other states. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has expressed support for legislation approved by the Texas Senate. North Carolina and Louisiana state lawmakers have also introduced bills.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox vetoed similar legislation in March, citing “technical issues.”Florida’s Republican-controlled legislature said the legislation was needed to curb social media companies’ outsize influence over the national conversation and who gets to participate in it.“Some of these massive, massive companies in Silicon Valley are exerting a power over our population that really has no precedent in American history,” DeSantis said during a bill-signing ceremony at Florida International University in Miami where he spoke from a lectern bearing a “Stop Big Tech Censorship” sign. “One of their major missions seems to be suppressing ideas.”Gov. DeSantis takes on 'Big Tech censorship' after Trump bansThe political right has complained for years that Big Tech stifles conservative voices and viewpoints.Trump made these “social media abuses” a major plank of his administration and reelection campaign.DeSantis voiced his support for the Florida legislation shortly after Trump and other conservative figures were booted from social media platforms in response to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.“Day in and day out, our freedom of speech as conservatives is under attack by the ‘big tech’ oligarchs in Silicon Valley. But in Florida, we said this egregious example of biased silencing will not be tolerated,” Rep. Blaise Ingoglia, who carried the bill in the House for DeSantis, said in a statement. Earlier this month, the Facebook Oversight Board upheld Trump’s suspension. But the company-funded panel of outside experts ruled that it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose an indefinite suspension and instructed the company to review the matter within six months, possibly opening the door to Trump's return.His account on YouTube is also still up, but he cannot upload videos. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in March that the Trump ban will be lifted “when we determine the risk of violence has decreased.” Snapchat and Twitter permanently banned Trump.Majorities in both parties think political censorship is likely occurring on social media, but that belief is most prevalent on the political right.Nine in 10 Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party say it’s at least somewhat likely that social media platforms censor political viewpoints they find objectionable, up slightly from 85% in 2018, according to a report last year from the Pew Research Center.Researchers say it’s difficult to know whether platforms are politically biased since social media companies disclose so little about how they decide what content is allowed. But that has not stopped the GOP from taking on Big Tech.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, confronted Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a Senate hearing last year over Facebook and Twitter throttling the spread of a New York Post article which made uncorroborated claims about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.“Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?” Cruz said.",author,date

Stop reading if you haven't seen the reboot in theaters and on HBO Max.He got Caged.There's big-time Hollywood irony that Johnny Cage, the catchphrase spewing, action movie star of the ""Mortal Kombat"" video game and movie franchise, failed to make an appearance in the long-anticipated movie reboot that opened this weekend.The fan-favorite character would chuckle knowing he was held back partially because he's such a big personality and the potential movie franchise has sought to establish an ensemble cast centered around once-struggling MMA fighter Cole Young (Lewis Tan). ""Johnny's character is his own gravitational field,"" says director Simon McQuoid. ""There was a lot of work to get the fundamentals and the world right in this movie. Johnny's just such a big personality and character that it might've thrown that off.""Whatever disappointment there was with fans not seeing Johnny Cage in the movie, there's hope for the future.Who is Sub-Zero? And why is he so mad? Joe Taslim explains his 'Mortal Kombat' villain's rage'Mortal Kombat' star: Lewis Tan talks disappointing 'Deadpool' death and ultimate Cole Young triumphThe final ""Mortal Kombat"" scene features world savior Young returning to the boxing gym where he'd taken beatings for $200 a fight and announcing he was heading off to Hollywood. As he exits, he passes a poster featuring the Hollywood action star Johnny Cage in a ""Citizen Cage"" movie poster, the oversized ""CAGE"" belt buckle the defining attribute. With Young's mandate from Lord Raiden to assemble new champions, the message is clear.""We're exploring Johnny Cage's involvement in a sequel,"" Tan tells USA TODAY. ""It's a great idea. We know the fans are crazy for it.""It is welcome news for fans, including actor Casper Van Dien, who played Johnny Cage in the 2013 ""Mortal Kombat: Legacy"" TV series. ""They really do need Johnny Cage, but maybe I’m slightly biased,"" says Van Dien, adding that the brash character has ""personality, maybe even a personality disorder. But when I was a kid playing 'Mortal Kombat,' I'd put my quarters in and play as Johnny Cage.""What to stream this Oscars weekend:HBO Max's 'Mortal Kombat,' Netflix's 'Stowaway'The film's movie poster cuts off at the torso, so it remains a mystery who would play Cage. But Van Dien, 52, says he's ready to rock if called. ""It would be a blast to be Johnny Cage again.""""I am training in the mornings, doing my kicks and punches. But by the time any next movie comes out, I might have to be Old Man Cage,"" says Van Dien.  ""Even if they got a younger guy, I’d love to see it.""Not to get too far ahead as Warner Bros. gauges fan interest in the first ""Mortal Kombat,"" McQuoid insists there have been no official sequel discussions and has ""no clue"" what any follow-up would include. ""'Mortal Kombat' is a rich treasure trove of characters. There's a lot to work with,"" McQuoid says. ""But we have built a set of rails with a joiner piece. So we can click something onto it if we need to.""Real tears for Sub-ZeroThe final ""Mortal Kombat"" battle scene featured villainous Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) facing his once-killed foe Hanzo Hasashi, now reborn as Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada). ""I've come from hell to kill you,"" Scorpion announces.As if this epic Sub-Zero v. Scorpion rematch were not enough, Young (Tan) joins Scorpion in the battle against the ice-controlling assassin, Sub-Zero.Even set in a frozen cage match setting, Tan says the three-person fight, with its challenging choreography, was made all the more difficult due to the on-set heat. Each cast member, performing their own fight sequences, was boiling due to extreme exertion and those bulky uniforms.""It's very hot and you can't just take those outfits off,"" says Tan. ""When I say we were sweating, we were sweating during like, eight hours straight of full-on exertion. We had ice packs, fans, electrolytes. It was extremely difficult.""Onscreen the battle turns against Sub-Zero, who eventually succumbs to the two fighters. Taslim was so into his character for the finale that the actor struggled mentally as the once invincible baddie Sub-Zero faltered.""He lost everything, he's catching his breath, crawling. I was devastated, but I needed to play this character to the end of the journey,"" says Taslim.  ""He knew he's going to die. That's the hardest part. So when he is crawling, I lost a lot of energy during that part. I broke down after take four, devastated for real. I just couldn't stand up. I think I just crossed the line.""In the final blow, Scorpion unleashes his hellfire onto Sub-Zero. Taslim had to go through hours of prosthetic makeup for the fake body burns before filming his final moments. The sight of horrifically burnt Sub-Zero was made all the more disturbing on the set since Taslim was such a popular guy.Matilda Kimber, the 13-year-old actress who plays Emily (and a Sub-Zero ice victim) adamantly refused to look at her beloved co-star in this condition.""We were good friends on set, so she couldn't see it. She didn't want to. She was almost crying. I told her, it's only makeup, but still, she would not look,"" says Taslim. ""It was very uncomfortable for everyone.""Sub-Zero was dead. But there's always the chance that he could return for a sequel, perhaps as the character's next incarnation Noob Saibot.""There's always possibility that we can continue the journey. I hope that comes true,"" says Taslim.",author,date
https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2021/05/30/savannah-silver-meteor-amtrak-train-florida-travel-fort-lauderdale/7431342002/,"Savannah, Georgia, is a perfect Amtrak starting point for those looking for an East Coast escape","The Silver Meteor pulls away quietly from the modest Savannah, Georgia, depot, just as it always did, before the isolation, before the pandemic.This is Amtrak’s southbound 97. Savannah is the approximate midpoint between Boston and Miami. The tag on my bike headed for baggage reads MIA. I’m hoping that means Miami and not “missing in action.” We’re heading to Hollywood, Florida. During the ride I find out from a very congenial car conductor, Mr. Appleman, that bikes cannot be unloaded in Hollywood. Someone goofed when we made the ticket. We make an adjustment. I text my friend to meet us in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.We joke around with our conductor. “Mr. Apple-man, meet Miss Fish-man.” Later, Mr. Appleman would call to say we left a book and a return ticket in the netted pocket of the seat in front of us. He would leave the book for us with Reuben or Deloris in the Savannah station. We could get a new ticket electronically. No penalty.  That’s a train, for you. Room for humanity, room for personality.“Kissimmee? Anyone getting off in Kissimmee? Last chance.” This from another conductor, his white curls tucking behind his collar. “Don’t forget your phone chargers. We have plenty of chargers in our lost and found.”Later, to replace the forgotten book, we would find a most extraordinary antique book store, William Chrisant & Sons’ Old Florida Book Shop, with rugs, narrow aisles, tall shelves and chandeliers on a most ordinary strip mall in Ft. Lauderdale. It’s sandwiched between and around the most banal of businesses notwithstanding a strip of four Vietnamese restaurants across the trafficked street, including 545 Banh Mi Café, which is now hiring (“Sandwich artists and prep cooks”).We eat like we’ve never eaten before, so tired are we of the home-cooked meals we bragged about over the past year and a quarter. Should it be Peruvian, Romanian, Greek, Ethiopian, Salvadoran, Korean?First-time train travelers are surprised at the affability of the conductors. “Where you headed, young woman?” they ask. “Winter Park? Two cars to the right.” They take your arm and guide you onto the four steps of the yellow stepstool into the car. They lift your walker. They hoist your suitcase, too. As the conductor shuffles a stack of paper, making marks with his yellow pencil, it seems unorganized, so 20th century, so analog. Somehow it works. People step up, find a seat of their own choosing and settle in.“Abuela, abuela,” a young toddler says pointing to me. Grandmother, grandmother. Yes and no, I say. Her mother apologizes. No need. We’re waiting in line at the snack bar. Only credit (or debit) cards at the snack bar. No cash since COVID. Best to bring your own food anyway. Most people do. No dining car on Amtrak’s Silver Service. Too bad. The coffee is decent; the microwavable food not so much. Mr. Appleman says he always travels with carrots.In Orlando, Florida, when we could get off the train for a “smoke break” while some 89 people line up to take the No. 98 northbound train, another line formed around a hot dog stand. There should be more food trucks at stations, if you ask me.Amtrak is serious about the mask mandate. (The federal mandate for masks on transpiration and at transportation hubs was extended until mid-September.)“If you’re not drinking or eating, please wear your mask,” the conductors announce and repeat as they patrol the aisles. There’s a proper way to talk on the phone, too. “You have to have a headset,” he instructs one young man talking (forever) on his cell.If you ever thought the borders between states are arbitrary, think again. As soon as we cruise into Florida at a civilized 79 miles an hour and pass small houses hidden behind twisted trees, gnarly vines, bald cypress, curving canals, mangrove roots, tulip poplars, the textured sea grapes, tipsy boats and cars with raised hoods, it feels different. Who can notice those things from a car? In South Florida, there are more varieties of palm trees than I knew existed. Blooming frangipani are common; so are the blue plumbago, the royal poinciana, the vibrant croton.But a few days later when we pulled into Savannah, it was to the blooming magnolia trees.

The only problem: Lots of other people have the same idea.This summer is expected to bring record boat traffic. The marine industry reports a 35% increase in first-time boat ownership from last year with 350,000 people nationally purchasing their first powerboat and an additional 65,000 buying their first personal watercraft, according to figures from Info-Link Technologies and the Coast Guard. ""2020 was a different year in the course of the boating industry and sales,"" Water Sports Foundation Executive Director Jim Emmons said. ""With social distancing and summer trips being canceled because of the coronavirus, people turned to boating in a big way.""""It's all about nautical distancing,"" said Gavan Hunt, the vice president of sales for Chris-Craft Boats based in Sarasota, Florida. ""Truly, it was a freedom people needed and wanted during the pandemic. It's one of the few places you could be with family and not be worried.""The National Marine Manufacturers Association reports $47 billion in sales of boats, marine products and related services nationally in 2020. It's the highest total in 13 years.""What we found in our research was that for a lot of people thinking about buying a boat for years that timeline was sped up due to the pandemic,"" Emmons said. ""People want to recreate in a safe way where they can follow social distancing.""Along with the influx of new boat owners, you'll see first-timers out in rental boats. In addition to the traditional rental services you find at marinas, these days, you can also book through peer-to-peer services like Boatsetter. You tell them the when and where, and the site shows you what's available in your area.If you’re ready to get out on the water, here are tips that may help if you're considering renting a boat.Make sure you're legalCheck with your rental company and state guidelines to learn the minimum age requirements for renting and operating a boat. Many states actually require would-be boaters to pass a course before operating a boat. Regardless of whether or not they're required, classes are still a good idea for inexperienced boaters.Speaking of rules, look into whether you need a license to fish where you're going. But Many states offer these services online as well as temporary licenses good for 24 hours, seven days or 15 days.Find the right boat  While it's important to choose a boat that's appropriate for your skill level and the number of people on the trip, it's even more crucial to pick the right boat for the water conditions you'll be in. Flatwater lakes and open oceans call for very different watercraft.You can also do a little pre-rental reconnaissance by visiting the water you plan to boat on. Which types and lengths of boats seem most common? If you can't go in person, try asking a local boating group on Facebook or Reddit what is most suitable for a particular body of water.Decide how long you need the boatIn some ways, boat rentals are a lot like car rentals. Generally speaking, the bigger and more powerful the boat, the more you'll pay. You'll need to put down a security deposit. Rentals are typically available by the hour, half day, full day or even a week. Paying by the hour is often the most expensive option, so consider whether one of the longer options might save you money.Get educatedFor those of us who may occasionally take the helm but don’t plan to become full-fledged boaters, the BoatUS Foundation offers free online boating safety courses that are tailored to each state; the courses are recognized by the U.S. Coast Guard and approved by state boat licensing agencies.Topics covered in the courses include the marine environment, boating equipment, trip preparation, safe operation, emergency preparation and boating activities. Once you settle on a boat and know its make and model, have the designated driver Google its owner's manual and get familiar with the controls and features ahead of time. Find out if your boat is equipped with an engine cut-off switch. It's an onboard safety device that is connected to the boat’s captain. Should the driver fall out of the boat, the cut-off switch will immediately stop the boat’s engine.Consider who will be captainThink about the people who will be on the boat and who among them has the most boating experience – or, at the very least, can be counted on to take a boating safety course and obtain a license before your trip.If you don't trust yourself or your companions to drive, consider hiring a captain to operate the boat. You can arrange for one through a boat rental company; their expertise on the water and knowledge of the best places to go can make for a fantastic outing. Opting for a captain can be more relaxing for the entire group so no one in the rental party has to “work” while on the water. If anyone in your group plans to water ski or wakeboard behind the boat, consider delegating people to watch them and keep an eye out for oncoming traffic and report to the driver.Observe COVID-19 and boat capacity rulesBe aware that COVID-19 protocols may still be in place in some states and counties, as well as at local businesses. For instance, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks in most situations, you may still need one to enter the rental office.Social-distancing rules may still dictate the number of people who can be on your boat. See if your state, county or city has any capacity limits before you invite too many people.Regardless of COVID-19, it's important to observe your boat's weight and occupancy limits, which are stated on its capacity plate, usually mounted near the helm or steering wheel.Wear a life jacket and file a float planEllen DeLeo, a Coast Guard Auxiliary commander based in Florida, hopes wearing a life jacket at all times is top of mind for boaters and passengers.""The most important thing is to have people prepared before something happens. That's why it's so important to wear a life jacket,"" says DeLeo. ""Once something happens, you don't understand how hard it is to get a life jacket on."" The Coast Guard says that of all the fatal boating incidents in 2019, 79% of victims drowned. Of those deaths, 86% were not wearing a life jacket.She also emphasizes the need to file a float plan that includes a description of the vessel, number of people on board, destination and the route being taken to the destination. You can file your own float plan through the Coast Guard's mobile app or website and send the information to friends and family who won't be on the boat with you.""If you're overdue for arrival, you want someone looking for you right away,"" DeLeo said.Speaking of life jackets, consider getting one for your phone. Cellphone dry sacks are watertight, transparent cases that allow you to operate the screen without opening the bag. They also come on lanyards that you can hang around your neck. That feature reduces the risk of your phone flying out of your hand when the boat speeds up after leaving a no-wake zone. You can find them for under $20 at Amazon or outdoor outfitters like REI.Ease back on the throttleBear in mind that America's waterways are usually especially crowded on summer holiday weekends, beginning with Memorial Day.If you’re new to boating with limited experience, don’t choose the busiest boating days of the year to travel to the most populated hot spot for boaters in the area. The ability to safely navigate, drop and set anchors and lines in confined spaces is exacerbated in close quarters.Also, watch your speed. You'll often encounter no-wake zones around docks, bridges and other spots where speed could cause accidents. Think of these as aquatic school zones. You need to slow down well before entering one and as long as you're in it, you can't go fast enough to create a wake behind your boat. You must remain at idle speed (around 5 mph) until you see the ""End no wake zone"" sign. Breaking the rules is a sure way to get stopped by the Coast Guard or local authorities.Discover Boating, which caters to newcomers, offers a primer on no-wake zones, along with a guide to boat ramp etiquette, as well as tips for avoiding running aground and collisions.Keep an eye on the skyStorms, lightning, changing tides, currents, winds and other inclement weather conditions can endanger the safety of boaters. Download a marine weather app to your phone before you head out for the day and check it throughout the trip. Should you be on a boat when Mother Nature unleashes her fury, find shelter as soon as possible.Don't forget to bring the essentialsFinally, pack a cooler with food and drinks. And don't forget to bring a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. It only takes one serious sunburn incident to realize how much light the water reflects. No drinking on dutyThis should go without saying, but we'll say it anyway: If you're piloting the boat, abstain from booze. The Coast Guard reported that alcohol was the leading contributing factor in fatal boat accidents in 2019, accounting for over 100 deaths, or 23% of total fatalities.""We want everybody to come home safe and have a great time,"" DeLeo says.Contributing: Adam Regan, Naples Daily News; Susan B.

There are hopes for a rebirth of a tourism industry that in Spain and Italy alone accounts for 13% of gross domestic product but was wiped out by the pandemic.Have COVID vaccine, will travel:These are the countries open to fully vaccinated Americans“We don’t speak of 2020. We speak of from today onward,” said Guglielmo Miani, president of Milan’s Montenapoleone luxury shopping district, where European and American tourists have started trickling back, wooed in part by in-person meetups with design teams and free breakfasts at iconic cafes. The hope is that Asian tourists will follow next year.Europe saw the largest decline in new COVID-19 infections and deaths this week compared with any other region, while also reporting about 44% of adults had received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Europe’s seven-day rolling average for new cases per 100,000 people had been higher than any other region from mid-October through the beginning of December, ceding the unwanted top spot to the Americas over the new year before reclaiming it from early February through April, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.Now, no European country is among the top 10 for new cases per 100,000 people. And only Georgia, Lithuania and Sweden are in the top 20.But the virus is spiking in Southeast Asia and much of Latin America and hitting the Maldives and Seychelles particularly hard this week. Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO's chief of emergencies, warned that with the global situation still “fragile and volatile,” Europe is by no means out of the woods.“Relaxing measures prematurely has contributed to the surge we have seen throughout 2020 and during the first quarter of 2021,” he warned. “We must stay the course while striving to increase vaccination coverage.”The biggest concern for Europe is the highly contagious variant first detected in India, which has brought that country to its knees and found a growing foothold in Britain. The British government warned Thursday that the variant from India accounts for 50% to 75% of all new infections and could delay its plans to lift remaining social restrictions on June 21.Coronavirus updates:variant that first appeared in India arrives in the US. Here's what to know.“If we’ve learned anything about this virus, it’s that once it starts to spread beyond a few cases, it becomes very difficult to contain,” said Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick. “Only extremely stringent local lockdowns soon after a few cases are detected will prevent the virus from spreading.”Rising British cases linked to the variant prompted Germany and France this week to require U.K. passengers to quarantine.Vaccines appear still to be highly effective against the variant detected in India, but it is important for people to get both doses to ensure full immunity, said Ravindra Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge.“In populations where there’s partial immunity, either from previous infection or low levels of antibody (from a single shot), then the virus will have that nice sort of sweet spot of an advantage of immune evasion, plus greater transmission,” he said.But that hasn’t stopped countries from trying to woo back tourists, even from Britain.Travel restriction updates:Europe is reopening to American vacationers after a pandemic travel ban. Here's what we know.At least 12,000 people from Britain began descending Friday on Porto, Portugal, for the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea. Visitors have to show a negative COVID-19 test to get into the stadium for Saturday's match, but no quarantines are required on either end of the trip.“Luckily I've had two vaccines,"" said Casper Glyn, a 51-year-old lawyer from London who came to Porto to cheer on Chelsea with his two young sons. “They are young and healthy, so I feel good.""On Monday, Spain lifted entry requirements — including the need for a negative virus test — for visitors from 10 countries, including the U.K. British travelers are highly sought after at Spanish beach resorts because they tend to spend the most.Spain lifted the measures after its two-week contagion rate dropped below 130 new infections per 100,000 people, down from a record of 900 at the end of January.Fernando Simón, head of Spain’s health emergency coordination center, said he would prefer authorities “shouted that Spain is open to tourism in 20 days, not now, when we still need to be cautious.”“I think we should lower the tone of euphoria a little,” he said.Greece, too, was voicing caution even after it recently allowed domestic travel and reopened most economic activity. About a third of the Greek population has received at least one vaccine dose, but new infections and deaths remain high.“Yes, hospitalizations are dropping, yes, deaths and intubations are down, (but) there are still people entering hospital who could have been vaccinated and weren’t,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, encouraging Greeks to get their shots.“And some, unfortunately, are losing their lives. It’s a tragedy,” he said.But elsewhere, the euphoria is real. There is a palpable sense of relief and hope as summer approaches in Poland, where the number of new daily infections has plummeted from over 35,000 in late March and early April to lows in the few hundreds. More than 19 million vaccine doses have been administered in the nation of 38 million.This week, North Macedonia closed all but one of its COVID-19 treatment centers and field hospitals following a dramatic 90% decline in confirmed cases. Italy and Cyprus are due to let restaurants reopen for indoor dining on Tuesday with discos — a big summertime moneymaker for southern European beach resorts — scheduled soon thereafter.The party was already underway in the Dutch city of Rotterdam last weekend when Maneskin — an Italian rock band that got its start singing on Rome’s central shopping street — won the Eurovision Song Contest.“The whole event was a relief,” lead singer Damiano David said. “This Eurovision means a lot, I think, to the whole of Europe. It’s going to be a lighthouse.”Jordans reported from Berlin and Barry from Milan.

The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline had previously announced plans to end its pause on alcohol sales in the economy cabin this summer but hadn't set a date.The federal face mask requirement for airplanes, airports and other modes of transportation currently runs through Sept. 13. Alcohol sales in American Airlines' main cabins were first suspended in late March 2020 to limit interactions between passengers and flight attendants amid the COVID pandemic. The decision to continue no alcohol sales through most of the summer comes after numerous accounts of unruly passengers in recent months, including one incident in which a Southwest Airlines flight attendant lost two teeth after allegedly being assaulted by a passenger. “Over the past week we’ve seen some of these stressors create deeply disturbing situations on board aircraft. Let me be clear: American Airlines will not tolerate assault or mistreatment of our crews,” Vice President of Flight Service Brady Byrnes said in the memo. “While we appreciate that customers and crewmembers are eager to return to ‘normal,’ we will move cautiously and deliberately when restoring pre-COVID practices.”Uptick in unruly passengers:Southwest Airlines passenger who allegedly struck flight attendant charged with felony batterySo what does that mean for passengers? Pre-departure beverage services remain suspended in the premium cabin (first and business class), but alcohol will continue to be offered in flight. Snack baskets will return in the premium cabin and will be offered on flights between 500 and 899 miles. In the main cabin, nonalcoholic beverages like canned drinks, juice, coffee and water will be available upon request for flights under 250 miles and will be included on longer flights. Southwest Airlines also ditched plans to resume alcohol sales this summer after the uptick in violent incidents with passengers.

Mark Coulson sentenced him to one year of unsupervised probation and a $5,000 fine.“It started as a consensual prank between me and the other pilot. I never imagined it would turn into this in a thousand years,” Haak said during a remote hearing.Federal prosecutors said in a news release that Haak had never met the first officer before that flight bound for Orlando on Aug. 10, 2020. After the plane reached its cruising altitude, Haak got out of the pilot’s seat, “disrobed” and began watching pornographic material on a laptop computer in the cockpit, prosecutors said.“As the plane continued its flight, Haak further engaged in inappropriate conduct in the cockpit, as the first officer continued to perform her duties as an assigned aircrew member,” the statement says.Flight incident:Southwest Airlines bans passenger who 'seriously assaulted' flight attendantBooze sales:Southwest Airlines postpones return of alcohol sales after incidents with unruly passengersThe first officer submitted a statement to the court but didn’t speak during Friday's hearing. The judge told Haak that his actions had a traumatic effect on the co-pilot and could have impacted the safety of passengers and other co-workers.Haak “had a duty to comport himself in a much more responsible manner,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Cunningham said.“This is not the kind of aberrant behavior that anyone should accept,” the prosecutor added.Cunningham said the first officer “unfortunately suffered some consequences” as a result of the incident that Haak “didn’t have anything to do with,” but he didn’t elaborate.“She had a right not to be subjected to this kind of behavior, regardless of what may have motivated it or prompted it,” the prosecutor said.Haak was charged in April with intentionally committing a lewd, indecent or obscene act in a public place, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 90 days in jail.

His last flight for the Dallas-based airline was on Aug. 31, 2020, three weeks after the incident that led to the criminal charge.Southwest spokesperson Chris Mainz said in a statement that the airline “does not tolerate behavior of this nature and will take prompt action if such conduct is substantiated.” Southwest only learned of Haak's behavior after he voluntarily left the airline, according to Mainz.“Nonetheless, Southwest did investigate the matter and as a result, ceased paying Mr. Haak any benefits he was entitled to receive as a result of his separation from (the airline),” Mainz said.Defense attorney Michael Salnick said Haak had a sterling career as a commercial pilot and received numerous accolades and supportive letters from passengers and colleagues, including one from Southwest chairman and CEO Gary Kelly on the day of Haak's retirement.“We are blessed that Southwest has been your home for so many years,"" Kelly wrote.Haak accepts responsibility for his conduct and ""offers no excuses,” his lawyer said in a court filing.Salnick argued that Haak deserves a lenient sentence given his “lifetime of hard work and kindness.”“The embarrassment and resulting publicity of this incident has in and of itself been humbling to Michael Haak and has served as punishment in many ways,” he wrote.",author,date

Steve Sisolak’s target date of June 1. Masks are still advised for people who haven’t received coronavirus vaccinations and in some places with large indoor gatherings.

That's not stopping Memorial Day road trips.,"NEW YORK — Memorial Day weekend gasoline prices are at their highest levels in seven years, but experts don’t expect the steep prices at the pumps to keep eager motorists off the road.After more than a year of caution during the coronavirus pandemic, there’s pent-up demand for travel. And with vaccination rates increasing and coronavirus cases falling, some people are seizing the opportunity for a change of scenery during what has traditionally been one of America’s busiest holiday travel weekends.“The industry is referring it to as ‘revenge travel,’” said Jeanette McGee, spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association. “People have more discretionary income, they’ve got a lot of PTO (paid time off) saved up, so they’re going totake more trips and spend more money.”► Memorial Day road trip:Here's when NOT to hit the road►Uber, Lyft shortages frustrate travelers:'I marinated in Fort Lauderdale for 45 minutes'Gas prices this weekendThe national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.03 this week. Memorial Day weekend prices have not been this high since 2014, when they averaged $3.65 a gallon.Prices recently had been slightly higher than the current average, due in part to fuel delivery problems caused by a cyberattack and then shutdown of a major fuel artery, the Colonial Pipeline. Gasoline prices have largely stabilized since that hacking incident, but prices are expected to remain in the $3-per-gallon range during the summer, experts say.The vaccine rollouthas encouraged a gradual return to normal activities, and a strong labor market is supporting work-related driving, but discretionary driving has room to grow, said Lenny Rodriguez, team lead at S&P Global Platts.How to plan a summer road trip in 2021:'Being flexible' is key this yearAAA anticipates that 37 million Americans will travel by car and plane on Memorial Day weekend. That’s up 60% from last year, when many were cautious about the pandemic and stayed home. But it is still 13% below pre-pandemic travel levels reached during 2019′s Memorial Day weekend.The association recommends filling up the gas tank before arriving at vacation destinations, because gasoline prices can be higher around popular tourist spots.",author,date

Is there more the airlines or FAA can do to get this situation under control?Unruly passengers pose a direct safety threat to passengers and crew. Increasingly during the pandemic, we have seen a rise in unruly, dangerous passengers on airliners.Airline crewmembers have rules and regulations that they must follow and so, too, must passengers.Earlier this year, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Transportation (of which the FAA is part) and Transportation Security Administration have said all travelers must wear their masks – properly – while in the airport, during boarding, inflight, and deplaning. And yes, that rule goes for vaccinated passengers, too.More recently, the TSA said passengers must continue doing so until Sept. 13.► Memorial Day travel:  Yes, airports will be mobbed. No, masks aren't optional. What to know about summer flightsThe mask requirement is reasonable for the health of all onboard. It is no different than prohibiting smoking, or requiring that seat belts be buckled when the seat belt sign is on.If a passenger refuses to comply with the requests of the flight attendant, then the captain will call security to remove the passenger. It is the captain’s decision whether or not a passenger is accepted for transportation.No, it does not matter that you have paid for a seat; the captain has the authority to have you removed if you do not comply. Nor will a threat to sue change the outcome once the captain has made the decision to remove you. No captain wants to have a passenger removed, however, if the safety of the flight is or could be compromised, then it is necessary.No, it does not matter that you have paid for a seat; the captain has the authority to have you removed if you do not comply. Nor will a threat to sue change the outcome once the captain has made the decision to remove you. You're getting off the plane. At that point, the only say you have in the matter is whether you go willingly or not.► Southwest Airlines flight attendant assaulted:  Passenger charged with felony battery after allegedly striking cabin crew member ► Memorial Day travel:  Yes, airports will be mobbed. No, masks aren't optional. What to know about summer flightsIf a passenger makes a threat, commits an act of violence, or interferes with a flight crewmember in their duties they are in violation of federal law and can be prosecuted. Prosecution can include fines and/or imprisonment. Additionally, a violator can be ban from future flights.I fully support the strict enforcement of these rules, regulations and laws. Harsh penalties are necessary and the FAA and federal authorities are right to aggressively pursue those passengers who endanger others.We work too hard to improve aviation safety to allow a few uncontrollable passengers to reduce safety in our aviation system.► Mask fights and BYOB breaches:  FAA proposes $64,500 in fines against five unruly airline passengers",author,date
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/05/30/israel-palestine-conflict-human-rights-abuses-gaza-west-bank/7472886002/,I'm a Palestinian American and my dad is older than the oppressive state of Israel,"To be Palestinian is to be perpetually gaslit. Each and every day, choices are made that all but ensure that the imbalance of power and continued oppression lives in perpetuity. From the nearly $4 billion per year handed over from the United States government to the Israeli government with no humanitarian strings attached to the propaganda machine of the Netanyahu regime – the Israeli government has no motivation to stop oppressing and brutalizing my people. This situation isn't complicated. In fact, it’s only 73 years old. My dad is older than the state of Israel. He was in his first year of life during the British Mandate, when the British government supported ""a national home"" for Jewish people, leading to the creation of Israel. My people call the 1948 war that uprooted Palestinians from their home ""al Nakba"". The rest of the world doesn’t have a name for it because it’s rarely even acknowledged.With the Israeli government’s feet pressed firmly on our necks, they still find ways to stab us in the heart. Members of the so-called “progressive” left still fail to see their own hypocrisy.I’m a proud Palestinian – and an American – and I’ve worked in politics and advocacy for over two decades. My work has always centered justice, equity and fairness. And the same people who call to ask me how to best ally with Black communities in their fight for self determination and how to provide support to Native peoples in their continued fight for sovereignty, tell me that I don’t understand history and the rise in support of Palestinian people is about “popularity.” The gaslighting is as blinding as it is maddening. Palestinians disparaged abroadI grew up in Texas, and I have a lighter complexion than the rest of my family. Which means that for my entire life, I’ve been Arab-undetected. That means people feel comfortable saying things in front of me they wouldn’t to the rest of my family: they’ve called me, my family, my people terrorists. They’ve quoted the Bible at me as justification for the persecution of Palestinian people. They’ve disparaged “those people” and assumed I would agree.I often let them dig the hole just deep enough before I reveal that I am Palestinian and that the majority of my family is actually Catholic. Because, yes, there are Palestinian Christians – Jesus Christ was Palestinian. Not that religion should matter in fighting bigotry and oppression, but it is an ignorance that must be named. The problem, in part, lies in the inability or refusal to separate true antisemitism from the legitimate critiques of the oppressive Israeli regimes that have reigned over Palestinians, carrying out human rights abuses that would not be justified in almost any other circumstance. Palestinians persecuted at homeLet’s start with the fact that Palestinians, and Arabs, are actually Semitic people. So the attack itself is not even accurate. Last month, Human Rights Watch released a report outlining the atrocities carried out against Palestinians and concluded that Palestinians are in fact living under apartheid.Israelis want to live without fear:Israel is the Jewish people's ancient home. We will always defend ourselves from Hamas.The accusations of antisemitism began immediately – an intentional tactic to distract from the truth. Even Jewish people who dare to speak out against this oppression are being attacked and labeled antisemitic. Meanwhile, Jewish settlers, bolstered by the Israeli government, are forcibly displacing Palestinian families from their homes. These details are conveniently forgotten while claiming Israel’s “right to defend itself.”The bottom line is standing up for Palestinians isn’t the same as antisemitism. Arabs are Semites too, and ethnic persecution is ethnic persecution. I may not live in Palestine, but the trauma I have to go through in order to go see my family and friends is painful and enraging. I have dual citizenship because of my parent’s forced Israeli citizenship. But I was born in the United States.Why am I being attacked?:I'm a Palestinian living in Gaza. No matter when it is or where I am, I know I'm not safe.When I fly to Tel Aviv, my U.S. passport is literally useless. I have been detained for hours on end. My family doesn’t know when to pick me up because my release is based on the whim of that particular day's security agents. I have been strip searched. My bags and electronics have been ripped apart and scanned and then scanned again and again.The security agents shuffle me from office to office and ask me absurd questions like when was my grandfather born? What was my great grandmother’s maiden name? Why don’t I speak Hebrew? This entire process is meant to anger and intimidate and remind me that I’m not equal. If my American citizenship can't protect me, imagine how vulnerable every Palestinian living from the West Bank to Gaza feels.Rania Batrice is a first-generation American, born to Palestinian parents, and the founder of Batrice & Associates, a communications, advocacy, organizing, and legislative strategy firm.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/05/30/american-cybersecurity-need-defend-ourselves-against-attacks/7455637002/,Washington has been asleep on cybersecurity. It's time to wake up.,"For far too long, Washington has been asleep on cybersecurity. America’s vulnerabilities have been exposed and bemoaned, but not seriously addressed, much less fixed.  While hackers grow bolder and more skilled, government policies and public and private funding lag behind the need. Cybersecurity continues to be a largely technical afterthought rather than a vital and integral part of the design and modernization of major systems on which the well-being and safety of Americans depend. Until the Colonial Pipeline attack, neither major infrastructure proposal from the Biden administration or Republicans in Congress even mentioned the word “cybersecurity” or “hacking.” On the Republican side, the narrow focus on “traditional infrastructure” has resulted in a 20th century framework that’s insufficient for 21st century infrastructure challenges. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, the push to define infrastructure to include a wide range of social spending programs has obscured focus on more basic infrastructure requirements.Keeping the American people safeElected officials have no higher responsibility than keeping the American people safe, and there is no greater threat to the safety of Americans than the cyber weaknesses of the systems that support our daily lives.This isn’t just an issue for policy wonks or wealthy financial institutions. This is a threat to the day-to-day lives of every American. Our drinking water supplies, electric power systems, petroleum and natural gas supplies, hospitals, vehicles, stop lights and road safety signs, air traffic control systems, railroads, and all the businesses selling us goods and services are vulnerable to attacks. If a group of criminals seeking $5 million in ransom could cause massive gas shortages across the East Coast, just imagine the damage an organization that simply wanted to cause destruction could inflict. The American people – regardless of political affiliation – overwhelmingly recognize the threat. According to a recent Gallup poll, Americans rank cyberterrorism as the top threat facing the country with 98% viewing it as a “critical” or “important” issue. On the state level, Governors and Mayors have been concerned about the threat and taking action. In Maryland, we've established the position of Maryland Chief Information Security Officer to coordinate cyber security efforts, launched an economic development strategy to accelerate growth in the cyber security industry, and created an apprenticeship program to prepare Marylanders to become certified cyber security analyst operators.But we cannot just address this challenge on the state level. Our National Governors Association’ initiative to rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure recommended that strengthening “security and resiliency by protecting America’s critical infrastructure from disaster and cyber threats” be one of the four key pillars for any federal infrastructure bill. It’s time for leaders in both parties to take action. We all have an important role to play, but for a threat this large the federal government must take the lead. We’re glad to see the Biden administration is taking steps to focus on this issue following the Colonial Pipeline hack, but this is the third consecutive federal administration to announce a cybersecurity plan. We can’t afford another thrown together in haste, announced with fanfare, but neither fully resourced nor fully implemented. George Floyd anniversary:Release police body camera videos of deadly arrestsTo keep the American people safe, we recommend the federal government take the following four steps:1) Define and enforce minimum cyber security standards for critical infrastructure systems.2) Assign legal responsibility for meeting those standards and penalties for failure. Establish the legal obligation of private sector organizations to participate in a national cybersecurity network, providing information on attacks on their networks, and taking the actions directed by government emergency response officials.Need for a comprehensive plan for safety3) Fund and establish a national cybersecurity network linking the control and response centers for major public and private networks, beginning with internet service providers and critical infrastructure components. 4) Using this national cybersecurity network, conduct regular tests and exercises to improve national cybersecurity readiness, to fix deficiencies, to develop and ensure the implementation of network improvements, and to deal with cyber-attacks as they occur.  Without a comprehensive and strategic plan that measures results and provides adequate resources, the individual initiatives of well-meaning executives and legislators will ultimately fall short of the urgent need. The consequences of that failure will not just be more disruptive attacks, but also the lost confidence of the public.After COVID:3 things that states can do now to fix health careA large majority of Americans are thoroughly convinced that our political system is fundamentally broken, that we are tragically divided, and that Washington cannot carry out its basic function of protecting the safety of American citizens. Though this vicious cycle of partisan distrust cannot be fixed overnight, let’s start by making the protection of America’s cybersecurity, beginning with critical infrastructure, a national bipartisan achievement.Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan) is the Republican governor of Maryland.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/05/29/capitol-attack-republicans-kill-commission-kean-hamilton/5258903001/,January 6 Commission defeat previews dangerous failures to come on voting and elections,"The Bible says the truth will set you free. Leading Republicans say the truth could cost you elections and power, so the hell with it.The successful Senate filibuster blocking an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol should not be viewed as just another round of dysfunction. Barring shocking displays of procedural courage by Democrats or political courage by Republicans, it is a preview of massive failures to come in the project of trying to preserve American democracy.“I’m deeply disappointed,” Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat who was vice chair of the 9/11 Commission, told me. He called the Jan. 6 riot “a very dark day in the history of our country. We came very close to losing our republic and our form of government. Obviously Congress should investigate.”Tragedy and fraught politics“The country needs to clear the air” and learn the facts, former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, the Republican chair of the 9/11 Commission, said in a separate interview. He said the many unanswered questions include how involved then-President Donald Trump was and why the Capitol was “so lightly defended.” Congress is rushing forward without information, Kean said – spending money to “refortify” the Capitol, but that won’t matter if we don’t find out who the groups were and how they did it. In a democracy, he added, “you never keep yourself safe just by building walls.”The 9/11 Commission was created in the wake of unimaginable tragedy and amid fraught politics. Some Democrats viewed George W. Bush as a president elected by the Supreme Court. Some Republicans worried about what would come out at the hearings.Election Day 2004 was less than two years away by the time the commission was formed and started work, seven months away when national security adviser Condoleezza Rice was grilled on the famous ""Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US"" briefing Bush received five weeks before the attacks, less than four months away when the commission released a report that reshaped laws, policies and our government. Now, Kean says, it is used as a college textbook.Would the January 6 commission become a “political weapon” for Democrats to aim at Republicans? At least two GOP senators suggested it would. Would the evenly divided commission, negotiated by GOP Rep. John Katko at the direction of leadership, be “slanted and unbalanced”? Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted it would.Mark your calendar:January 6, 2025 could be the date American democracy dies ""Is there going to be politics in it? Heck, there's politics in everything we do around here,"" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters a day before she and five other Republicans voted for the commission. She said decisions should not be made ""for short-term political gain at the expense of understanding and acknowledging what was in front of us on January 6.""Any investigation can get off-track, Hamilton said, and added: “If you follow the argument of the opponents, we would never investigate anything.” That’s just what Kean fears. ""If we can't do it for this one, can we do it for COVID?"" he asks. ""That's very sad.""When the 9/11 Commission was blocked in the House, ""what knocked it loose were the families of 9/11. They knew they didn't have the facts,"" Kean said. Even now he marvels at their tenacity, their protests and how they showed up all 20 times he testified on Capitol Hill. They were ubiquitous and, he says, numerous, given that nearly 3,000 people were killed in those attacks.The Capitol attack led to three police deaths and over 140 police injured. They are trying to pressure Congress, but they are a relatively small group. Lawmakers and aides were also terrified survivors of that day, but only some of them want to ""rock the boat,"" as Murkowski put it when asked if her colleagues feared Trump's reaction to a ""yes"" vote and what might be revealed. Filibuster foreshadows defeatsThere have been plenty of commissions since November 2002, when Bush signed the law creating the 9/11 Commission, but none triggered by so momentous an event; none with existential stakes. The 1/6 Commission would have been an exception.Kean, Hamilton, Murkowski and others still hold out hope for an independent, bipartisan investigation of some sort. ""We must find a way to do this,"" Hamilton said. ""We have to get to the bottom of it. If you don't understand what happened and why, how can you prevent it from happening again? The answer is, you cannot.""Block, not tackle:Senators swore to support America, not the filibuster. Kill it to save the January 6 commission.And yet, with a filibuster rule in place, requiring a 60-vote supermajority to consider a bill in a Senate divided 50-50, you almost certainly cannot pass a bipartisan investigative commission – or election reforms, voting rights, ethics standards and other laws to safeguard democracy.The 54-vote “defeat” of the 1/6 Commission mirrors another defeat on another theoretically bipartisan bill eight years ago. It was a few months after 26 children and adults were shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Bereaved families looked on from the galleries as senators voted on whether to break a filibuster on a gun background check expansion bill sponsored by Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey. It got 54 votes.Count on the Senate to break your heart.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/05/29/lgbtq-gay-summer-camp-family-growth-confidence/7486588002/,"Too young to admit I was gay, here's how I learned to stop complaining and love summer camp","A few weeks back, our son Lucas, age 9 – who’s surely owed an adventure after the masked-up pandemic summer of 2020 – selected these electives for his upcoming time at sleepaway camp: the climbing wall, the ninja warrior course, and not one but two sessions of soccer.My picks when I went to camp at Lucas’ age were a touch different: drama, singing, and two sessions of arts and crafts.Outdoorsy and athletic, Lucas told me and his other father, Jack, that he wants to maximize the experience and attend camp for all seven weeks: “Dad and Pops, I can’t wait to get to the woods.” Quiet and flabby, I could only bear to attend for a fraction of that: “Mommy, do I really have to go?”See, I was never cut out for sleepaway camp. But by the summer’s end, I had changed – and it was because of camp and specifically, a handful of supportive counselors.The great indoors, and outdoorsWhile too young to acknowledge I was gay, I was hardly fit to spend a summer with a bunch of boys in the wilderness. A lover of the great indoors, I was already deeply fixated on movies, TV and books. I shined in the schoolroom, far from the soccer field. I was attached to my mother, sister and my female teachers. As my cousin says, I was always one of the girls.While the boys in my bunk were thrilled to play sports, I sat on the sidelines waiting for 3 p.m., when I got to dull the pain with M&M’s at the canteen. My nemesis, an aggressive kid named Micah, took advantage of my athletic ineptitude, constantly tripping and punching me. The sunset mosquitoes seemed to target me more than the other campers, munching me up and down my arms and legs. At night, I’d quietly sob myself to sleep.But then a funny thing happened once I stopped whining. With guidance from some empathetic counselors, camp made me a better version of myself.USA TODAY's Louie Villalobos:We're vaccinated but our son isn't. The CDC lifted mask rules. So what do we do now?I discovered untapped skills. A chubby kid who never wanted to take off his shirt, I found I was actually decent at one sport – swimming – and the college-aged lifeguard counted as I clocked dozens of laps in the camp pool. When it came time for “Color Wars,” an athletic competition where the camp was divided into teams, I advanced quickly, encouraged by a nurturing male leader who showed me the game was largely strategic – more brain than brawn. Plus a trusted counselor slipped me some B-1 pills to help solve my mosquito problem.Camp also gave me the chance during afternoon downtime to dig into new obsessions that would deepen as I grew into a teenager. One of them was music. When the other boys played tag outside, I was free to lie on my bunk with headphones, rewinding cassettes of singles again and again that I’d recorded from the radio.Most crucially, I fell in love with the 7:45 p.m. “Evening Program,” where all the bunks gathered in the central mess hall to watch skits and musical comedy. It was heaven for this future theater junkie. I was so enraptured by the presentations that by camp’s end, staffers installed me as a mini emcee, introducing acts and entertaining the campers, most of whom looked up at me either scornfully or bored out of their little minds. I didn’t care. I was a natural. The next morning, I’d jump out of bed and immediately ask my male bunk counselors, “So what’s the Evening Program tonight?”I was showing – and starting to embrace – my theatricality, my exaggerated mannerisms. My, well, campy behavior.Find your tribeStill, I never went back to sleepaway camp. In those years, my parents were struggling, drifting toward their eventual separation and moving homes regularly. My sister and I changed schools four times in four years.Follow the science:Let my children take off their masks, the science says it is safeReflecting on it today, I wish I had returned to those woods every year. With a safe refuge from my family’s issues, perhaps I would have benefited from the stability and developed confidence earlier? Maybe I could have found my tribe faster and come to accept that I was gay without so much self-torment? Many kids experience their first kiss at camp. Why not me?I know Lucas will succeed at camp in ways I never fathomed. He's already well ahead of the game, far more comfortable in his youthful skin than I ever was. (Asked by a stranger in a park at age 5 if he needed help finding his mother, Lucas shrugged and said, “I have two dads,” then rejoined his game of hide-and-seek.) I’m excited for our son, at the outset of his wonder years, to start to unravel some of life’s great mysteries in an environment designed to nurture one’s character.  A month after camp ended that long-ago summer, a memento arrived in the mail. It was the flimsiest of yearbooks: eight or so pages, stapled together, with a section for each bunk. On my cabin’s page, my counselors wrote, “Bradley’s Pet Peeve: Micah.” Guess he and I never got over our issues. But it said something else: “Bradley’s Favorite Quote: ‘What’s the Evening Program?’”I didn’t get it at the time. But today I see that, like the best mentors, those counselors were helping kids find their true selves. Those nurturing young adults – similar to a few key teachers I’d meet in the following years – were celebrating campy little me.Bradley Jacobs Sigesmund, an NYC-based journalist who’s written for Bloomberg, Newsweek and Us Weekly, is penning a TV pilot about a sports-averse gay dad with a soccer-obsessed son.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/05/29/emily-wilder-ap-charge-pro-israel-bias-fire-her/5245745001/,About AP and Emily Wilder: What does a reporter owe a news organization?,"I have some sympathy for the Associated Press as it’s being pummeled for firing a young reporter over social media posts.Not a lot of sympathy, mind you. The decision to fire Emily Wilder weeks into her new job for allegedly partisan tweets was ham-handed. A rookie reporter with great promise should be called into an office for a conversation and warning rather than a termination.The outrage over the AP’s decision grew after the public learned that Wilder’s pro-Palestine views as a Stanford student led to her being targeted by right-wing groups decrying her hiring by the AP. That in turn led to accusations that the world’s most prominent news organization had buckled to political pressure.More:Why Joe Biden won't solve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or bring peace to the Middle EastFrankly, the AP needs to issue a list of exactly what tweets violated its social media policy, which “prohibits employees from openly expressing their opinions on political matters and other public issues for fear that could damage the news organization's reputation for objectivity and jeopardize its many reporters around the world.” Otherwise the assumption is that Wilder is being punished for exercising her free speech rights in college. On Wednesday, the AP acknowledged “mistakes of process, but not of outcome.”But if the AP erred, so did Wilder. Tweeting is pro-active, an intentional decision to share your views with the world in hopes of persuading others. Depending on your role as a professional, that may have consequences.There are plenty of jobs where an errant tweet can get you fired. If you’re a Democratic fundraiser, your employer has a right to expect you not to tweet criticism of President Biden. If you’re a health professional, your boss can fire you for tweets saying COVID-19 was a hoax. And if you’re a law enforcement officer, your supervisor will be angered by a tweet that attacks the Black Lives Matter movement.In each of these cases, a provocative statement by an employee can undercut the credibility of a department, create internal conflict and distract the organization from its mission.So, too, does a tweet by an AP reporter about news coverage of the Middle East: ""objectivity' feels fickle when the basic terms we use to report news implicitly take a claim. using 'Israel' but never 'Palestine,' or 'war' but not 'siege and occupation' are political choices — yet media make those exact choices all the time without being flagged as biased.""Pro-Israel bias Wilder is accusing the news media – and implicitly her employers – of a pro-Israel bias because of the words they choose in reporting the conflict. It can feel good to lay out your unvarnished opinion for others to applaud, but Wilder’s first duty is to her colleagues reporting today in every possible hot spot in the world. These professionals strive daily to report factually and fairly. If they’re perceived as favoring one side over another, their personal safety is at risk.As a young reporter, I knew that I had an obligation not to inject myself into public matters. I didn’t question it. That was just the cost of being a news professional.Later, when I was editor of USA TODAY and other newspapers, I had the same expectation of my reporters. No politics. No causes. And nothing that would impair your ability to reflect all sides. And if a reporter was unwilling to accept those limits, they weren’t going to be a good fit for our newsroom.Objective realityI’ve heard younger journalists say that true objectivity is impossible and that they have a right to free speech. I respect the view, but I also know the value of being able to talk freely to a source who has no reason to question your sincerity or motives. Informing the public on behalf of a respected news organization is a privilege that comes with responsibility.The Associated Press has done noble and heroic work spanning decades, often at great risk to those doing the reporting. The AP is simply asking its journalists to focus on the news and stay off the soapbox. That’s the job.Ken Paulson is the director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University, a former editor of USA TODAY and a member of the USA TODAY Board of Contributors.",author,date

But now is not the time.  Because there shouldn't be any stigma attached to mental illness. It's a message that Americans must embrace beyond Mental Health Awareness Month.It's so important, particularly during pandemic recovery, that Jim Irsay, billionaire owner of the Indianapolis Colts, created a Kicking the Stigma family initiative and raised more than $4.5 million this month to help generate awareness about mental health disorders and expand treatment options and resources.Irsay said the initiative was the brainchild of his three daughters, Carlie, Casey and Kalen. Conversations around mental health and wellness and equitable access to treatment is the first step in helping people realize they are not alone in the struggle.""We're involved in so many different aspects of charitable giving, but we wanted to really focus on one and have a legacy that we could get behind,"" Irsay told me. ""Particularly with the pandemic going on, mental health is really at a crisis level. It already was at a crisis level before we got into the COVID situation, but afterwards, with the isolation, with the economic hardships and those worried about self preservation, it really became apparent that is was really, really needed."" A counter-punch to the pandemicIrsay characterized Kicking the Stigma as a counter-punch to the pandemic, an unintended consequence that can ultimately be viewed as a positive instead of a negative. Concrete statistics on how COVID-19 affected those suffering from obsessive compulsive disorders, postpartum depression or eating disorders, for example, aren't readily available, he said, but anecdotal evidence has shown Americans are in need of compassionate understanding.""We don't know the fallout effect for the next five or 10 years from the pandemic,"" Irsay said. ""But I can assure you it has made the ground more unsettled and led to many, many other problems.""Money from the inaugural fundraiser, which raised $2,273,449 – and was matched by Irsay – will be used to support expanded programming by Mental Health America Indiana, the National Alliance on Mental Health – Greater Indianapolis, Project Healthy Minds and Bring Change to Mind. The fund also will provide grants to Indiana-based nonprofits working in education, support and advocacy of mental health.It's a framework that can be used nationally, he said. Using a grant formula, nonprofit agencies that offer mental health support and services in each state could widen their safety net with the help of additional resources. ""I would love to look back 100 years from now and say, 'You know, 100 years ago, Kick the Stigma began, and now we've raised $2.2 trillion.'"" ""We know it affects every single household, every single family; every person brushes across it in life,"" Irsay said of mental illness. ""These illnesses, like all illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, etc., they're all very difficult to take on and defeat. But when you add a stigma to illnesses that are life threatening – and these are – it becomes just that more difficult.""Zoom, working out, a 'holy dog'Irsay has had his fair share of heartbreak and public battles with addiction. His grandfather and father both from alcoholism. His sister, Roberta, was killed in a 1971 car crash at 14. His only brother, Tom, was born severely mentally impaired. He died in 1999 at age 45.Irsay became addicted to prescription drugs after he was treated for chronic hip and back pain. In 2002, he sought treatment after his name was linked to a federal and local investigation involving possible prescription drug fraud by a local plastic surgeon. In a 2010 interview with USA TODAY, Irsay openly detailed a long history of recreational drug use – including mushrooms, LSD, alcohol and cocaine – as a younger man. And in 2014, Irsay went back into rehab after he was arrested for impaired driving and found with opioids in his system.I asked Irsay if he struggled with his own sobriety during the pandemic. He said thankfully he did not, and used the opportunity to focus on learning things like Zoom, working out and spending time with his 3-year-old dog, Drake, who he refers to as his ""holy dog."" Still, being unable to see his children and grandchildren was as difficult for him as it was millions of other Americans.""I'm diligent about my recovery,"" Irsay told me. ""It's like amazing grace; it comes from a higher power, and it just starts with the willingness for people to say, 'Help me, I surrender, I can't do it. God, you can, I'm turning my life and my will over to the care of God.'"" A hole in his soul filled with serviceIrsay described a hole in his soul that can only be filled by being selfless and of service to others. He inherited a franchise football team and saw the glory of a Super Bowl win, he said there's nothing more fulfilling in life than giving of yourself. And addressing mental illness could change the fabric of this nation.""It just struck a big chord with me because I know it's been pervasive in this world, for the human race for a long time, and certainly in my family,"" Irsay told me. ""The worst thing with the stigma with mental health illnesses is people feel alone. And if you feel alone that's never, never a good thing.""So that's really important to me, you know, not to just create legacies, but hopefully leave funding behind, that allows the legacies to grow and flourish to create a better human existence and make the world better.""Well done, Mr. Irsay. Well done. National columnist Suzette Hackney is a member of USA TODAY’S Editorial Board. Contact her at shackney@usatoday.com or on Twitter: @suzyscribe",author,date

But as frustrating as that cyberattack was to consumers and business operators, consider this: Much worse things could damage critical infrastructure. With terrorist groups and ill-meaning nation-states like Iran and Syria striving to disrupt our way of life, future attacks are likely to occur in more than one domain. On Thursday, Microsoft warned that the Russian-based group behind last year's SolarWinds hack had launched a new campaign targeting 150 organizations, mostly in the United States.The prolific hacker group, which Microsoft refers to as Nobelium and is widely believed to be run by Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, launched the current attacks after getting access to an email marketing service used by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, according to Microsoft.While it is impossible to prepare for all possible scenarios, we should at least prepare for those that already have laid bare our weaknesses.America Talks:Should the U.S. have stricter laws on the sale of guns?The attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the spread of COVID-19 reveal troubling national vulnerabilities. We should prepare for both cyber and biological attacks to occur simultaneously.   A report soon to be released by the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense finds all critical infrastructure sectors are at biological risk. The consequences of intentional, accidental and natural biological incidents occurring are truly worrisome.  None of our nation’s 16 critical infrastructure sectors (including the health care and public health sector and the food and agriculture sector) has planned adequately for biological incidents.They have not determined how they will operate in a biologically contaminated environment, identified how they contribute to biodefense, examined the biological threat to their operations, determined how they are vulnerable to biological threats, or estimated the consequences of biological incidents harming their sectors.  Critical infrastructure is unprotectedIt is no wonder then, that all critical infrastructure sectors found themselves unprotected and operationally compromised when COVID-19 spread to the United States and throughout the world.And if the private sector is looking to the federal government to do something about this, it will experience what we saw during the pandemic: a government that remains woefully underprepared.  All critical infrastructure owners and operators must accept that a biological incident will likely harm their sectors, and then plan and prepare accordingly. Ignoring the danger may well lead to horrendous consequences within each sector and throughout society. COVID-19 provided a powerful example of how our nation’s food and agriculture sector can easily be upended. Food-processing facilities were hit hard by the pandemic, forcing work stoppages when employees could not come to work. In December 2014, migrating wild birds brought a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza to the United States. The ensuing outbreak resulted in the largest animal health disaster ever experienced by the United States.Federal and state governments spent $879 million in response. The outbreak affected 21 states, lasted until the middle of 2015, and led to the loss of more than 50 million birds on 232 farms.Subsequent trade bans affected as many as 233,770 farms. The total cost to the U.S. economy was estimated at $3.3 billion.The estimated economic impact of COVID-19 to the U.S. economy is $16 trillion and climbing. Biological threats are increasingThe increasing rate of emerging and reemerging diseases, along with biological threats and attempts by those with nefarious intent to attack, point to the need to reduce the risk to America’s critical infrastructure.COVID-19 is not just about the health care and public health sector any more than the Colonial Pipeline is just about the transportation systems sector. When you consider how vulnerable all sectors (such as chemical, dams, financial services, and government facilities sectors) you realize just how big a challenge we face.  Shame on us if we don’t see the connection between COVID-19 and the Colonial Pipeline hack. Both were made much worse from lack of planning and the inability or unwillingness to face obvious possibilities.The food we eat, the water we drink, the electricity and gasoline that power our world – all must be protected. We must work to protect our critical infrastructure now, before illness, death and economic disaster overcome the nation and the world.  Tom Ridge, a former Republican governor of Pennsylvania and first U.S. secretary of Homeland Security, and former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle serve on the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense.",author,date

I was eight years old and had been playing tennis half my life.I am a woman who grew up in the world of sports. State ranked in Georgia by the age of 10, I was invited with my sister Melanie, also state ranked, to staff tournaments for the world’s best tennis players at the Alexander Memorial Coliseum (now McCamish Pavilion) on Georgia Tech’s campus in Atlanta.Fast forward 30 years and I found running. In my life, there is no sport that fills me with such hope, clarity, with the sense that anything is possible, as the sport of running.The rush is so powerful, so healing, that it propelled me to two Boston Marathon finishes and multiple age group awards in the sport of triathlon.  Inspiration for The GenderCool ProjectWomen’s sports has defined my life in the deepest, most profound ways. It has allowed me to thrive personally and professionally in ways I could never have imagined.Folks will be hard pressed to find someone more vigorously supportive of women’s sports than me.  As the mother of four, I have done everything I can to model for our three sons and our youngest, our daughter Chazzie, that finding their own connection to athletics can be one of the greatest joys in their lives.Chazzie is 15 and proud to be transgender. She is fueled by her passion to volunteer, works hard in school, was the inspiration for The GenderCool Project, and is “open” to exercising with me.   The truth is, sports is not her thing. It’s all I can do to get her to take a walk with me. To her credit, she’s the first to say she loves the way an awesome walk makes her feel.It’s all a work in progress.   Like so many teenagers, Chazzie is thrilled to be back in person at her high school. Next year, she plans to participate in a program called Charity Drive. Each year her high school raises significant money for those in need in our community, including pediatric cancer patients, our beloved veterans and military families. The high school sports teams are often the ones that raise the largest portion of this money. Chazzie wants to join the girl’s volleyball team, in part, so she can participate in Charity Drive and raise money for those in need. She has no experience playing volleyball, and that’s OK. My husband John and I are proud of her for trying something that will teach her teamwork and perseverance, while allowing her to give back. All kids need to move. And all kids need to feel that they belong.  America Talks:Come #ListenFirst in a conversation to bridge political dividesA lawsuit limiting the participation of transgender girls in high school sports, orchestrated by a group that does not believe in equal rights for all people, has now been dismissed in federal district court. And yet, it has spurred a series of bad bills based on fiction in select states across the country. These bills seek to dry up an entire ocean for kids who simply want a few drops of water. In my years of advocating for inclusivity, I have found the overwhelming majority of transgender and non-binary kiddos just aren’t that interested in the competitive side of athletics. And the tiny percentage who are, are not the fastest fish in the sea. They are not the strongest, the most agile, the most competitive. On the contrary, it’s a running joke among so many of our families that whoever finds the secret to getting our kids to move will have a building named after them! Transgender athletes aren't a threat Here’s another truth: there are common-sense guidelines within most athletic organizations on the high school, collegiate and professional level. Policies developed by medical experts have been in place at the NCAA and Olympic levels for years now allowing transgender athletes to compete, and yet we have never seen a transgender woman in the Olympics, or any kind of domination of women's sports by transgender athletes. We also know that in some states with inclusive policies, participation rates for girls in high school sports are stronger.I’ve seen all sorts of terrible things happening within women’s sports including unequal pay, sexual abuse and harassment. Transgender girls and women are not and never will be a challenge to women’s sports.In 2018 Boston Marathon winner, Desiree Linden, stopped and waited as her friend and fellow elite women's runner Shalane Flanagan took a quick break during the race. That one moment, that stunning example of women racers at the highest level, being there for each other, even as they competed against each other, said everything about what is real and true and beautiful about women’s sports. Women’s sports is as much about lifting each other up as it is about winning. Our values, our fundamental beliefs, even as competitors, should be grounded in celebrating all who simply want to belong. Jennifer Grosshandler, she/her, is founder of The GenderCool Project.",author,date
